Clair
Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello?\n...I think we have a bad connection.\rCould you try again from another spot?
Nice to hear from you.\nHow is everything with you?\fI’m good.\r
There are a lot more stronger\nGym Leaders than me...\fSo get tough or go home!
What’s your point?\nIf you want to battle me again, fine.\fFriday nights, take it or leave it.\rCall me then... Maybe I’ll answer...
Well, well, you called at the right time!\nYou want to battle again?\rI’m up for it.{YESNO 0}
Ha ha ha.\nIt’s great that you’re stepping up.\rI’ll be waiting for you at the\nFighting Dojo in Saffron City!
What in the world?\nAre you trying to make fun of me?!
You figure you want to battle me?\rI’m wondering if you have time enough\nto do me justice.\rI hear you made promises to meet some\nother people. You should respect those\ffirst, is what I think.
I’m waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo\nin Saffron City...\fDon’t wuss out.
Yes, it’s Clair here...\nOh, hi. How are you doing?\r
Keep in mind we’re meeting at the\nFighting Dojo in Saffron City.\fIt’s a promise I’m waiting to keep...
Lately some people from the\nRadio Station came around, wanting to\fdo a piece on me, or something.\rMy fans definitely won’t want to\nmiss watching that!\rOh, no! I was confused! It’s radio!\nAll those people tuning in, and they\fwon’t be able to see my glorious face!\rWhat about TV?\nWhy hasn’t a TV crew come to do a piece\fon me?!
Lately there seems to be some gossip\nrunning through town that I am the\flatest name in fashion.\rWell, if I’m that cool that people can’t\nstop talking about me, I can totally\funderstand that sentiment.
Wow, you seem like you’re a pretty busy\nperson, aren’t you? Even more than\fI am, if that could possibly be.\rI mean, I’ve got my Gym work, and I’ve\ngot to go see the Elder at the\fDragon Tamer’s shrine, too.\rWhat do you think?\nYou’ve got talent--you could become\fa Dragon Tamer, too. Think so?
