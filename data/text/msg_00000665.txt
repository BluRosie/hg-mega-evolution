Hello, is this {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}?\rThat reminds me... Telephones, they\nchange your voice into electricity to\fcarry it over a long distance,\fdon’t they?\rSo, if you consider that technology,\nyou could change Pokémon into\felectricity and send them over large\fdistances as well, no?\rSo, based on that theory, I was able to\ncome up with and create the Pokémon\fStorage system!\rWell, it’s not quite as simple as a\ntelephone, but you get the idea, right?
