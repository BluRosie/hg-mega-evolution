Hi!\rRed’s been away. He hasn’t called\neither, so I have no idea where he\fis or what he’s been doing.\rThey say no news is good news,\nbut I do worry about him.
I worry about Red getting hurt or\nsick, but he’s a boy. I’m proud that\fhe is doing what he wants to do.
They have shows that aren’t\naired in Johto...
