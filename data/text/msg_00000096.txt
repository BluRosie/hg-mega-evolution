We look forward to your next visit.\r
You can call me the Judge.\rHeheh, it’s actually not my real name,\nbut that’s what everyone calls me.\rIt’s because of this weird power I\nhave. It’s a gift, really.\rI can discern--judge you can say--the\noverall potential of individual Pokémon.\rIf you’d like, I could judge the\nintriguing potential of your Pokémon.\r
If you’d like, I could judge the\nintriguing potential of your Pokémon.\r
...Oh.\nYou don’t need me to judge. I get it.
Judge an Egg?!\nThat’s a tall order even for me.\r
I see, I see...\rThis Pokémon’s potential is decent all\naround.\rThat’s my determination, and it’s final.\r
I see, I see...\rThis Pokémon’s potential is above\naverage overall.\rThat’s my determination, and it’s final.\r
I see, I see...\rThis Pokémon has relatively superior\npotential overall.\rThat’s my determination, and it’s final.\r
I see, I see...\rThis Pokémon has outstanding potential\noverall.\rThat’s my determination, and it’s final.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its HP.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Attack stat.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Defense stat.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Sp. Atk stat.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Sp. Def stat.\r
Incidentally, I would say the best\npotential lies in its Speed stat.\r
It’s rather decent in that regard.\nThat’s how I judged it.
It’s very good in that regard.\nThat’s how I judged it.
It’s fantastic in that regard.\nThat’s how I judged it.
It can’t be better in that regard.\nThat’s how I judged it.
A Ribbon will be awarded to the\nparticipating Pokémon!
