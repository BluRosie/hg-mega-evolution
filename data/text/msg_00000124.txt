A long time ago, the Whirl Islands used\nto be one large island.\rThere were two countries fighting over\nthe island back then.\rLUGIA, the guardian of the island, got\nupset and cast lightning bolts to tear\fthe island into four pieces, then\fdisappeared into the deep end\fof the waterfall basin...\rI will let you through if you bring the\nSilver Wing, which is said to have fallen\ffrom LUGIA.\rBut the true challenge is whether\nLUGIA will appear in front of you.\rWhat LUGIA has longed for is the\ninvisible trust between people and\fPokémon...\rOr the person who can restore such\na relationship...
LUGIA, the Pokémon of the island, hid\nitself deep in the end of the waterfall\fbasin, and no one has seen it since...\rIf anyone who could restore deep trust\nbetween people and Pokémon were to\fcome here with something linked to\fLUGIA, it may show itself for such\fa person...
That thing you have...!\r
You have found it...\nPlease go ahead.\r
You have found it...\nPlease go ahead.
Silver Wing will merely permit you to go\ndown the waterfall.\rIf you are not the kind of person who\nwould restore the trust between people\fand Pokémon, LUGIA will never show\fitself to you...
Hmmm.\rSo it was you and the Bell!
You are quite a remarkable Trainer\nfor your age...
