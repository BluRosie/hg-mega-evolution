Zuki: Yes, this is where we welcome\nHO-OH.\rWhen the dance we practiced for many\ndays becomes one with the sound of the\fClear Bell we entrusted to you,\rthen HO-OH shall come down from the\ngreat arch of the sky once again!\r
This is all we can do for you...\nWhat you do now is entirely up to you...
That IS indeed HO-OH...\nThe guardian of the sky around here\ffrom ancient times...\rSo many have tried and tried, only\nto fail...\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, your heart and the Clear\nBell in harmony have finally made\fit appear...\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, don’t you see?\rHO-OH must have been waiting for\nsomeone like you all this time.\fWouldn’t you agree...?\r
HO-OH: Shaoooh!\r
You have done a great job.\nSay hello to Professor Elm for us.
You have not only made HO-OH appear,\nbut you have also caught it...\rYou are so wonderful.\nThere is nothing more for us to say.\rTake good care of yourself in\nyour journey...
If that is what you believe, we will not\ntry to convince you otherwise.\rStill, if you want to see HO-OH once\nmore, perhaps you can come back here\fafter everything has been settled...
I think when you turn your back to it,\nHO-OH will not come back for\fsome time...\rIf you want to see HO-OH, perhaps you\ncan come back here after everything\fhas been settled...
