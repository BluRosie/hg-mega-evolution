DRAGONAIR’s cute, but I don’t have\nit. Do you have DRAGONAIR㊛?\rWant to trade it for my DODRIO? {YESNO 0}
Wow! Thank you!\nI always wanted DRAGONAIR!
That’s not DRAGONAIR㊛.\nPlease trade with me if you get one.
You don’t want to trade?\nOh, darn...
How is that DODRIO I traded you doing?\rYour DRAGONAIR’s so cute!
Oh?\nYour {STRVAR_1 0, 0, 0}...\r
It has worked stupendously hard,\nhasn’t it?\rAs its reward, please give it\nthe Effort Ribbon.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1, 0} received\nthe Effort Ribbon.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 1, 0} put the Effort Ribbon\non {STRVAR_1 0, 0, 0}.
It needs to work a little harder.\rIf it does, I’ll give your Pokémon\nsomething nice.
It’s working a little harder, I see.\rBut it will need some more effort!
It’s working hard, I see.\rBut it will need just a little\nmore effort!
It’s working quite hard, I see.\rBut it will need a tiny bit\nmore effort!
It’s working so hard, I see.\rIt’s almost there.\nJust the smallest bit of effort, and\fit’ll be there!
Oh! That Effort Ribbon looks\ngood on your {STRVAR_1 0, 0, 0}!
