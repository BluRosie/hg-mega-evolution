Hi! Is it your first time here at\nthe Safari Zone? {YESNO 0}
Welcome, Owner!\nShould I explain the Safari Zone? {YESNO 0}
At the Safari Zone, you can enjoy a\nSafari Game where you are given {STRVAR_1 51, 1, 0}\fSafari Balls to try to catch Pokémon.\rWhen you have run out of Safari Balls,\nthe game is over.\rWhen you see a Pokémon, you can choose\nto throw Bait or Mud.\rIf you throw Bait, Pokémon tend to stay\nbut will become more difficult to catch.\rIf you throw Mud, it will become easier\nto catch, but the Pokémon may flee.\rHave fun at the Safari Zone!
Have fun at the Safari Zone!
Warden Baoba has something important\nto share with you!
This is the Area Customizer.\nWhat would you like to know about? {YESNO 0}
The Safari Zone has six Areas.\rPlains Area...\nPeak Area...\fand so on.\rThe Area Customizer allows you to\nchange the combination of these Areas.\rWhat would you like to know? {YESNO 0}
Check out the machine, and you’ll see\nthe Area Customizer screen.\rThe lower window shows the current\nSafari Zone setting.\rSelect an Area with the A Button to\nswap it with another.\rWhat would you like to know? {YESNO 0}
When you select an Area, then select\nSwap, you will see 12 new Areas.\rSelect one of them by highlighting it and\npressing the A Button.\rWhat would you like to know? {YESNO 0}
When you select an Area, then select\nOrder, the Area type will not change,\fbut the location can now be changed.\rWhat would you like to know? {YESNO 0}
Different Areas have different Pokémon\nliving in them, so when you change\fAreas, you will see different Pokémon.\rPlease do try the different Areas!\nWhat would you like to know? {YESNO 0}
I am sorry, but this can’t be used yet.\nWarden Baoba has a great plan for this\fmachine...or so he says. But even we\fdon’t know what it is. It’s a secret.
Please enjoy the Area Customizer!
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} turned on\nthe Area Customizer!\r
It is still under development.
Hi, I have been waiting for you!\nWhat do you think?\rThis is a brand-new Safari Zone.\nBy the way...\rI just had an idea.\nWould you like to take the Owner\fAptitude Test? {YESNO 0}
Right on!\nLet me explain how the test works.\fIt’s very easy.\rAll you have to do is to catch one\nGEODUDE at the Safari and show it to me.\rThey are in the grass closest to the\nentrance. It shouldn’t take long\fbefore you catch one.\rGood luck!
Wow, I never thought anyone\nwould decline!\rYou can become the Safari Zone Owner,\ndon’t you see?\rOwner...\nIt’s got a nice ring to it, doesn’t it?\rYou should try the test! {YESNO 0}
Oh, wonderful!\nYou’ve caught a GEODUDE!\fYou’ve passed the first test.\r..................\rHuh? Didn’t I tell you that there are\ntwo tests?\rThat’s right!\nBecoming an owner is not that easy.\rThe second test is...\nWell, I am still preparing for it.\rI will let you know once it’s ready.\nYou need to wait just a little.\fI will call you with the Pokégear.
Show me the GEODUDE once you’ve\ncaught one.\rThey are in the grass closest to the\nentrance. It shouldn’t take long.\rGood luck!
I’ve been waiting for you!\nThe test is ready.\rThis time can you catch a SANDSHREW\nand show it to me?\rSounds easy, right? Not really!\nSANDSHREW will not appear with the\fcurrent Safari Zone setting.\rAnd that’s where this comes in handy!\r
This sophisticated, high-tech machine\nlets you customize Safari Zone Areas.\fI call it the Area Customizer!\rYou want to know how it works,\ndon’t you?\fIt’s a...secret!\rWell, you shouldn’t have trouble\noperating it. Just talk to the staff\fnext to me!\r
I almost forgot!\rI was in the middle of explaining\nthe second test, wasn’t I?\rYou will not see SANDSHREW\nwith the current Safari Zone Areas,\rso you have to use the Area Customizer\nto change them.\rSANDSHREW live in the desert!\nGood luck!
You did it!\rYou caught a SANDSHREW!\nI knew you could do it.\rYou’ve passed the test!\nYou are now the Safari Zone Owner!\r
I’ve always wanted to see young people\nplaying at the safari!\rI thought I might get some new ideas.\nThat should help you complete your\fPokédex.\rThat’s what I have been thinking.\r
By the way, though you are now the\nSafari Zone Owner, would you kindly\fcontinue to pay admission?\fWe have our reasons.\rDon’t be upset. I’ll keep thinking about\nhow I can create new fun ways to\fhelp you complete your Pokédex.\rGo have fun at the Safari Zone!
I will let you know as soon as I come up\nwith something new, using the Pokégear!
Show me the SANDSHREW once you’ve\ncaught one. SANDSHREW live in the\fdesert! Good luck!
Slow down.\rOnce the next test is ready, I will call\nyou using the Pokégear.\rGive me some time, OK?
Hi, I have been waiting for you!\rI had an epiphany!\nA new attraction!\rI’ve decided to call it...\nObject Arrangement!\rThis is going to be fun!\nYou can place objects on the field as\fyou play at the Safari Zone!\r
Not only that, but the types of\nPokémon you see will change depending\fon the types of objects you place.\rIsn’t it amazing?\nI will call you using the Pokégear if\fsomething else comes up!\r
I will explain Object Arrangement.\nWould you like to know anything? {YESNO 0}
I will explain Object Arrangement.\nFeel free to ask me any questions.\r
There are many objects you can place\nanywhere as you walk around the Safari\fZone, except on stairs and grass where\fPokémon appear!\rYou also want to remember that you can\nplace up to 30 objects in an Area.\rWould you like to know anything\nelse? {YESNO 0}
It is easy to place objects. All you\nhave to do is make sure that the spot\fin front of you is clear.\rIf it’s empty, you can select\nan object.\rSome objects are large and may need a\nlarge space.\rWould you like to know anything\nelse? {YESNO 0}
If you want to remove an object, just\nwalk up to it and check it. The objects\fyou have placed will glow in the dark.\fIt should help you at night.\rWould you like to know anything\nelse? {YESNO 0}
There are many different objects.\nOnes that look like grass, like trees,\flike boulders, like water, and other\ftypes of objects...\rTry placing different objects. The\nnumber of objects placed in an Area\fis shown in the Area Customizer\fon the top screen.\rThere will be more objects to come,\nas I’ll keep adding more.\rWould you like to know anything\nelse? {YESNO 0}
The types of Pokémon you see will\nchange depending on the types\fof objects you place.\rThe Safari Zone is also changed\nat that point. Try placing different\ftypes of objects.\rWould you like to know anything\nelse? {YESNO 0}
Beware!\rOnce you’ve swapped Areas, the\nobjects you placed will all be removed.\rWould you like to know\nanything else? {YESNO 0}
I hope you enjoy it!\nGo, and have fun!
