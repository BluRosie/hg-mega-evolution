And we’re off!
We did it, yeah!\r
Uncle!\r
My Pokémon are a cut apart from the\nusual. Maybe even two cuts!
Their cutting intensity and solid\nattack... Top class, yeah?\r
Grr...\nRendered harmless...\r
The prince among shorts-wearing\nYoungsters, that is me!
I hope I lived up to my title of the\nprince among the shorts wearers.\r
I can’t lose here! Not as the prince\namong the wearers of shorts!\r
I can’t bear this tension.\nWould they be mad if I went home?
I did it!\nI won somehow!\r
That’s gone past my limit!\nI need to be excused!\r
I’m not very good at this, but please\ndon’t hold back.
Oh, didn’t I say?\nYou shouldn’t have held back.\r
Fweh! I wish you would have held back a\nlittle bit!\r
In romance, fashion, and Pokémon!\nToday’s girls want it all!
The greed of today’s girls knows\nno bounds!\r
Did being greedy end up costing\nme everything?\r
I’m thinking hard about why everyone\nlikes battling so much.
Why does winning a battle make\npeople happy?\r
Why is losing a battle so\ndownright infuriating?\r
I’m trying to keep up with my Pokémon\ntraining and my own schooling.
I’d like to think I’ve struck the right\nbalance of fun and education.\r
This isn’t going to work?\nMy grades are the best in class, but...\r
I crammed hard for this.\nI can’t possibly fail!
Yes! I get the win!\nI’m glad I kept with this!\r
It means I need to study at home\nsome more.\r
My Pokémon are my treasures.\nI’ll let you see them. Just you.
See? Cute and strong!\nEheheheh.\r
See? They’re cute even when losing.\nEheheheh.\r
I won’t lose ever!\nPlease abide by my rule!
Thank you so much!\nI owe this win to you!\r
I so did not want to lose...\r
I can do this...\nI can shine here, too!
Yes! I won!\nI’m going to be a star!\r
One day, I’m going to shine as the\nbrightest star in the world!\r
Don’t be shy.\nYou can bring it any which way.
Yeah, I figured you’d be like this.\nHeh.\r
W-well, sometimes I have to lose, just\nso I don’t crush everyone. Ahaha...\r
My father’s wealthy.\nThere’s nothing he can’t afford.
My father’s money bought my Pokémon.\r
There are things that money can’t buy.\nI know that...\r
Well, shall we?\nTime is money, and the meter is running.
Well, I’ll take my leave. Yet another\nfancy dinner date, you know. Adieu!\r
It’s my loss, is it? So be it.\nI had to leave for a date anyway.\r
Uphold the rules of etiquette and\ncourtesy... That’s what a lady does.
If I couldn’t unwind this way, I would\nlose my ladylike composure.\r
I wish I could be free like the bird\nPokémon in the skies...\r
If I were Honey, then you would be\nGooey Mulch, I would think.
Do you see now?\nHow different we are in level and class?\r
How dare you!\nI won’t forget this humiliation ever!\r
Partying, shopping, dining...\nDarling, I’ve grown bored of it all.
Excitement is so lacking in my life.\nWhat will send my heart racing?\r
Only battling lifts me from this idle\nexistence of boredom and apathy...\r
I’m glad to make your acquaintance!\nMay this friendship be fruitful!
Thank you very much!\nThank you so very much!\r
Thank you very much...\n...Pah.\r
The most natural Trainer is...\nOh, why hide it? None other than me!
This is the natural outcome.\nIt was inevitable!\r
I was battling naturally, and ended up\nwith the loss.\r
Yes! Not a grown-up!\nLucky me! I stand a chance!
Yup, battling another kid is a lot\nless scary.\r
I get really nervous in front of\ngrown-ups.\r
It’s hard to keep the streak alive,\nbut the battles are fun.
It’s more fun to win, of course!\r
Even losing is fun.\nIt’s the wonder of Pokémon!\r
My daddy is a real mountain man. Does\nthat make my mom a mountain woman?
Mountain woman sounds icky.\nNot for me, thank you!\r
I’m their daughter. Is being a mountain\nwoman my destiny?\r
I have a packed lunch all ready, and of\ncourse I have some snacks.
My favorite Pokémon make winning\nso easy!\r
Oh, no, no! I forgot to bring my\nfavorite Pokémon!\r
I frolic with my water Pokémon in a pool\nall the time.
It sure makes me happy winning with my\nPokémon favorites.\r
I’d love to swim in a pool full of water\nPokémon.\r
I promised Mommy I’ll practice swimming\nif I lose.
Yay! I won’t have to go to the pool\nwith Mommy today!\r
Aww, I lost. Now I’ll have to go to\nswimming practice today.\r
I went and caught my Pokémon with\nmy daddy.
I won, Daddy!\nDaddy, thank you!\r
I wonder if Daddy will show me how to\ntrain my Pokémon next?\r
I’m on the way home from the pool, but\nOK, I can battle.
I hope I can go home soon.\nI need some dry clothes!\r
Ah-ah-atchoo! Aww...\nAtchoo! We lost...\r
I’m the captain of a heroic vessel\namong the crashing waves of a storm!
Made it to shore with the ease of a\nreal swashbuckler!\r
That was a bigger crash than I wanted!\r
I just now got back from my vacation.
The beach is a good place to show off.\r
Ooh, my sunburn is itching.\r
Hunh? A battle, is that it?\nSure thing, sure thing.
Hey, you’re something special, huh?\r
Yeah, thanks for your time.\r
This is going out to all the ladies.\nBabes, I sing and battle for you!
My ladies, my babes, I won for you.\nYour love is my power, right?\r
I lost, but my love for the babes can’t\nbe beat...maybe.\r
This is no guitar I have here.\nIt’s traditional and Japanese.
It has only three strings.\nCan you tell what this is?\r
My instrument is called a shamisen.\r
We teen Idols have a secret code\nof conduct that’s strictly enforced.
For example, if an Idol wins, she has\nto squeal and jump around.\r
If an Idol loses, she must never act\nangry. That’s a big no-no.\r
Do the monster Meteor Mash!\nIt’s my catchphrase!
My Meteor Mash goes to your heart!\r
All Idols need a catchphrase,\nespecially right after their debut.\r
You’re ever so lucky to get the chance\nto battle with me.
You’re super lucky to even battle\nan Idol like me. Don’t you get it?\r
Huh? Huh? Now, why did you win?\nYou know I’m supposed to win!\r
Krink... Krak... Heheheh.\nLet me limber up for this.
Hah!\nWeak, even for a joke!\r
Gnnrrr...\nI have only myself to blame...\r
Aren’t they pretty? Adorable?\nThey’re my beloved Pokémon.
You worked so hard! I’ll give you a nice\nmassage at home.\r
What are you doing to my Pokémon?!\nWhat if you hurt them?!\r
I come before you as a member of the\nPokémon Fan Club! En garde!
Long live the Pokémon Fan Club!\nMay it always be glorious!\r
This is hardly a taste of what the\nPokémon Fan Club can bring down...\r
Fan Club Department Manager...\nI hereby accept your challenge.
Heheh... Honestly, you thought you\nstood a chance against the Fan Club?\r
Gwah! I will be avenged...\nB-by the Division Manager...\r
Raising Pokémon with love isn’t the same\nas coddling them. Don’t you see?
Ooh, you did it! Oh, I love you so!\nMy luvly, wuvly Pokémon!\r
How could you?!\nWhat if my Pokémon are injured?!\r
On behalf of my village, I take on\nthis challenge!
Thank you, everyone!\nThank you for your vocal support!\r
Fellow villagers, I’m sorry!\nMy best wasn’t enough!\r
Thank you for your patience.\nHere is the battle you’d ordered.
I trust you were satisfied?\nI feel shortchanged somewhat.\r
I trust you were satisfied?\nI’ve had my fill.\r
Work is fun, and Pokémon also.\nI am happy I come to this country.
Having fun I am!\nI hoping to live here forever.\r
Oh, why you beat me? So mean!\nI want go home to my country.\r
I’m cool, right? So, everywhere I work,\nthey make me the maitre d’...
I’m a good battler, too. I can’t help it\nthat the ladies fall for me.\r
I dream of evolving from a maitre d’ to\na celebrity chef.\r
There are no free deals on a battle.\nYou’ll get the full course, though.
Where’s the fun if you don’t battle\nlike you mean it?\r
I take work and play seriously.\nThat’s what sparks my passion!\r
Hi, may I interest you in a meal combo?\n...I’m so used to saying that at work!
Thank you, and have a great day!\n...What am I saying?\r
We look forward to your next visit!\n...What am I thinking?\r
Your team looks impressive.\nWill I be OK...?
Oh, what?\nAre those Pokémon only for Contests?\r
Ouch! I said ouch!\nIt was too much! Way, way too much!\r
I love bug Pokémon!\nI love my bug net even more!
I caught my Pokémon using my trusty\nbug net.\r
It’d be cool if there was a bug net\nPokémon.\r
The bugs are my minions, and I’m the\nboss. Are you prepared to lose?
Wahaha!\nWell done, my minions!\r
We were mowed down...\nMy minions have learned the hard way!\r
I’m breaking out of my shell!\nI’m taking it to the next level!
It’s like I’ve sprouted wings!\nViva to the new me!\r
Is it not my time yet?\nDo I need to stay in my shell longer?\r
You transgressor!\nHold still, I say!
I willed myself to victory!\r
C-curses...\nI’ve brought dishonor on us...\r
Hey, hey, what’s that over there?\nIt’s... It’s a legendary Pokémon!
Kekeke... Ninjutsu misdirection!\nIt worked to perfection!\r
Ninjutsu misdirection was a failure!\nI’ll disappear in a puff of smoke!\r
You’ll be befuddled by my\ndazzling speed!
Your movements...\nIt’s as if you’re moving in molasses.\r
I didn’t need to do all that dashing\naround, did I?\r
I’ve been wearing these clothes for a\nlong time. Bathing is for the birds!
Changing clothes takes too much effort.\nTaking a bath is even worse!\r
No, no, no!\nI won’t take a bath!\r
I like my mommy, PIKACHU, and my daddy,\ntoo.
A weak Trainer isn’t cool.\nI don’t like you.\r
A not-wimpy Trainer is cool.\nI like you.\r
Pikapika pikaah!\nPikka! Pikachuuuh!
Piika pikapikka!\nPikka pikkachuuh!\r
Pikka ppi pi piii...\r
When I enter battle, I picture the vast\nsea in my mind.
When I can envision the sea, I feel as if\nI could never lose.\r
When I envision the sea, I don’t feel\nthe sting of defeat.\r
In battle and in love, one needs to\nknow when it is best to back off.
After all, both battle and romance can\nbecome quagmires of despair.\r
I may have lost, but I said something\ndeep, in an endless bog kind of way.\r
I’m afraid I got cursed on our last\nexploration of ancient ruins. Ehehe.
Even just now, I have no idea how I won.\nHeeheehee.\r
I may be cursed, but this is fun.\nIt is all so very good. Heeheehee.\r
Seeing buildings and towns from the old\nages sends my pulse racing.
People interested in old architecture\nare potential Ruin Maniacs.
Open your eyes in towns. There will be\nexciting new discoveries. I mean it.
I put this team together with my\nInternet buddies. It took us all day!
We won! I need to thank my Internet\nbuddies for their advice!\r
Aww, darn it! We lost?!\nI’ll report it to my Internet buddies!\r
I’m the main character of this story.\nIt’s impossible for me to lose.
You’re good! Though, as a supporting\ncharacter, you’re a bit too strong.\r
...The hero has to suffer a bit so the\naudience feels more empathy.\r
I’m very fickle. I can’t stick with any\none thing for very long.
I won, and it’s enough for me.\nI’m going to check out the Wi-Fi Plaza.\r
I lost, so that’s enough. I’ll go to\nthe Safari Zone.\r
I have a ton more experience than you.\nWhat will you do about it?
Not bad, but you need more maturing.\r
Experience alone doesn’t ensure any\nwins, I’m learning.\r
Don’t you think Pokémon battles are a\nlot like the weather?
Winning makes me feel warm and cheerful\nlike a sunny day.\r
Losing makes me sad like a dreary,\ncloudy day.\r
I was out all night at a party again.\nI’m feeling dizzy from playing games!
I’m so bored of fancy parties and silly\ngames, too.\r
Urp...!\r
Ooh, aren’t you the most darling thing!\nCan you win a smile from me?
Ooh, sweetie, I win, so no smile!\nBe sure to win next time!\r
I don’t feel like smiling now...but\nI’ll be happy to wave good-bye!\r
...Oh, wait one second.\nI have to take this call.
Hi, yup... Yeah, battling... Uh-huh...\nYup, I won... Well, duh... LOL...\r
Hi, yup... Yes, just battled... Nope...\nKid beat me... Uh-huh...\r
Snivel! Hnurrff! Snort!\nThis hay fever is a wicked misery...
Hnurrff! Snivel! Snivel! Snivel!\nI won, but the misery continues!\r
Sniffle. Snivel. Snort.\nI’m not crying. My nose is running.\r
My acute sense of smell tells me how\ntough a Trainer is.
Keep trying. My nose tells me\nyou have great potential.\r
Sniff, sniff... Snort! My nose tells me\nyou’ve been working hard!\r
Kyahaha! I smell a powerful battle\nin the making!
The sweet smell of success!\r
Defeat smells like a SKUNTANK!\r
I like hard, fast beats in my battling\nand my rock ’n’ roll! Let’s wail!
And, bam! That rhythm pattern ruled,\nif I may say so myself!\r
Ouch! That’s an insult to the ears!\nThose beats were offensive, man!\r
To show you how much this means to me,\nI’ll use sound effects from now on.
Raaaah! Dun dun! Dun dun!\nOompa-oompa-oompapa!\r
Blip-bip, blip-bip... Blip... Bweeee...\r
Wait, please wait...\nThe winds... I hear them...
I can hear them...\nThe winds are laughing...\r
I can hear them...\nThe winds... They are in tears...\r
I can’t fly...\nBut these babies can soar...
My spirit has been uplifted to the\nskies... Thank you, everyone...\r
You broke my wings...\nI won’t ever forget you...\r
Every day, I’m like a migratory bird,\nbut I go in all cardinal directions.
I gained experience while traveling to\nall sorts of places.\r
I’d love to live somewhere where I can\nfind other Trainers like you.\r
I was born unto rolling waves that\nwashed me, with the beach, my cradle.
I was born and grew up on the seas.\nThat’s what made me the big man I am.\r
I lost, did I? Time to go to the sea\nand stare inscrutably at it.
Youths of today aim for the world!\nHow’s that for deep!
There’d be some mighty cool Trainers\naround the world. I’m sure of that.\r
Go on, kid! Take on the world!\nI’ll look forward to your return!\r
What’s that? I smell dusty?\nDon’t you know the aroma of soil?
See, that’s what you get!\nYour team had to eat dirt, get it?\r
Dropped in the dirt by some kid who\ndoesn’t know the smell of soil!\r
Sorry for looking so scruffy and dirty.\nI’ve been holed up in the mountains.
I wasn’t really holed up, at least not\non purpose. I was lost out there.\r
It’s better to be holed up in the\nmountains than in your room, I say.\r
I’m not supposed to be here.\nCan we do this on the sly?
Even battling can draw attention.\nIt’s not easy being a pop star.\r
Pop stars are ordinary girls at heart.\nWe want to enjoy our Pokémon, too!\r
I’m a self-made celebrity.\nDo you have a problem with that?
A celebrity is a celebrity, even if it’s\nin my own mind.\r
I want to be the center of attention,\njust me and only me.\r
I’m facing retirement soon...\nI was never admired as an Idol.
I’m going to shine as a star battler\nof Pokémon!\r
I would have liked to end my career\nwith a win in this match...
I think training Pokémon shares a lot of\nsimilarities with a marathon. You agree?
There’s meaning in sticking with your\ntraining regimen every day.\r
If you don’t pace yourself, you\ncan’t win.\r
Howdy! Let’s keep it clean, fair,\nrefreshing, and pleasant!
Whew, I feel invigorated!\nPokémon are the greatest!\r
Uh, haha...ha... It actually feels kinda\ncleansing to be thrashed this badly.\r
It’s the Workers of the world like us\nwho keep the world going.
There are times we would like to lay\ndown our tools and rest.\r
Don’t forget how Workers like us work\nfor you.\r
My wife and boy are waiting on me back\nhome. I can’t afford to lose!
I’m sorry, but I had to do this. You’ll\nget tougher with a family behind you.\r
Oh, no! How am I supposed to show my\nface around my dear wife and boy now?\r
Pokémon are like family to me.\n...Nah, they are family.
Yes! My family, you did it!\nWe knocked off that mean Trainer!\r
Fwaaaah! That’s cruel!\nMy family’s hurting!\r
I was too lenient with my Pokémon.\nThey grew up all selfish on me.
Hey, now, enough. Stop attacking!\nThe battle’s long over already.\r
Hey, now, the battle’s over and done.\nNo attacking the Trainer.\r
You, there. Don’t look around now.\nPay attention to me. Focus.
Kid, you’re grossly underpowered.\nYou ought to train with me.\r
Oh, yeah. You’re better than you look.\nI was wrong about you, kid.\r
Go, my Pokémon.\nBut don’t strain yourselves.
Oh, wow, I like how tough everyone was.\nOur Pokémon and you, yup.\r
OK, nice try, gang.\nThanks much for trying.\r
My papa’s dream...\nI’m going to make it real.
Papa, did you see?\nWe did it all for you...\r
We lost...\nPapa, I am so sorry...\r
I’d like to take a break.\n...No? We have to begin right away?
Aww, see? You should have taken a\nbreak with me before.\r
Ooh, aren’t you a tough one?\nYou should take breaks, though.\r
Yes, yes, looking good!\nI need a smile now. Can you do that?
No, no, no. I need a smile from you.\nLet’s see those teeth sparkle!\r
Yes, that’s a good smile!\nNow tilt your head toward me.\r
You probably can’t tell, but I can see\nright down to your pores.
Yes, I see it, indeed.\nI can see you clearly.\r
I zoomed in on you too much.\nI couldn’t see your Pokémon.\r
While battling, I’ll keep looking for the\nbest shot of you.
There! And there again!\nDecisive moments in time!\r
Shots of me losing?\nThose get deleted immediately.\r
I’ll be bringing you live coverage from\nmy imminent battle!
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has\ncarried the day! Go, me!\r
Our intrepid and beautiful Reporter has\ngone down in defeat. Take pity on me!\r
I hate admitting it, but I wanted to be\nan Idol, too.
I didn’t want to lose to any Idol.\nThat motivated me to train.\r
This is crushing... I work so much\nharder than any silly Idol...\r
This microphone is what made me a star.\nIt’s my all and everything.
Even for a battle, I don’t let this\nmicrophone leave my hand.\r
...Thud. Bzzzzt...\r
Hey, ’sup. I should warn you, I’m right\nfast, Trainer. Hold on to your hat.
Trainer, from now on, you can start\nadding Mister to my name.\r
Trainer, that was a real learning\nexperience. Thank you, seriously.\r
This Bike has become an extension of\nmy very being.
Any damage to my Bike, I feel the pain\nas if it were mine to bear.\r
Please! I’ll ask you to keep your filthy\nhands off my Bike.\r
When I was little, I hated cycling.\nI couldn’t get the hang of it.
I love cycling now.\nI’ve made many friends riding.\r
Can you ride a Bike?\nIt’s healthy and a lot of fun.\r
I’ll ride toward the breaking dawn with\nyou on my mind.
I will shift my gears higher and higher\nuntil I catch up to you...\r
My tires have deflated, and\nso has my heart...\r
Let the curtains rise on the festivities\nof muscles and Pokémon!
Did you enjoy our demonstration of\nmuscles and Pokémon?\r
Though I’ve lost, my muscles and\nPokémon are seared into your mind.\r
They say I have fists of steel and the\nheart of a child.
Oh, yay! Yippee!\nI won, I won!\r
Oh, boo! Boo! This stinks!\nI’m not talking to you!\r
Hwoaaah...\nHwoaaah...
Howatchah!\nHowaaatchaah!\r
Fweeeh...\nFweeehhh...\r
In my dictionary, there is no entry\nfor “restraint.”
The greatest show of respect among\nTrainers is to battle all out.\r
I went all out and still lost.\nOf course it stings.\r
A professional martial artist is in\nperpetual control of his body.
A martial artist must be more than\nstrong. He must also be wise.\r
Gah! I overdid my training and ran out\nof stamina early...\r
When I close my eyes, I can picture you\nbeing defeated. Come on.
Why be sad?\nYou knew this was coming.\r
I berate myself for my own lack of\ncare...\r
I don’t like to move much.\nI trained using the Net and TV.
Uhihi! I’m a naturally talented pro at\nboth karate and Pokémon, I am.\r
Oh, man, this is rotten! I’m tired and\nhungry and want to go home!\r
...To get this far, I had to make\nsacrifices. Many, many sacrifices.
It’s for this one moment that I live.\r
What else do I have to give up so I can\nbeat you?\r
First, let’s battle.\nTalking can wait.
That wasn’t bad at all, yup.\nThat goes for you and your Pokémon.\r
You’re a tough one, yup.\nWhere do you do your training?\r
Cute little Trainer!\nWe’ll squash you flat.
Eheh! You’re so cute when you look\nangry and frustrated!\r
What do you think you’re doing?\nI hate to lose, I’ll have you know!\r
My precious Pokémon will set you right!
My Pokémon have no flaws that you\ncan exploit!\r
I apologize, my dear Pokémon...\nI was caught unprepared...\r
Fwo-fwo-fwo. Youngster, what’s most\nimportant is to never give up.
If you give up, that’s it.\nThe game’s over.\r
Fwo-fwo-fwo.\nYou’re an admirable Trainer already.\r
I can tell by the way you look, you’re\nquite taken with my dandy style!
You shouldn’t be so mesmerized by me.\nLike a MOTHIM drawn to a flame!\r
Oh, you’re not interested in me?\nYou’re just SHELLOS, if I say so myself.\r
Oh, hello, aren’t you a sweetie!\nAre you sure you’re up to this?
Oh, now, please don’t cry.\nYou should be proud of yourself, dear.\r
Oh, my... You’re quite the capable\npractitioner of the art.\r
You and your Pokémon could use an\nobedience lesson from me.
This isn’t over until I say.\nOnce more.\r
You defy me?\nHow very amusing.\r
Over the years, I’ve crossed paths\nwith many a Trainer.
They were all wonderful Trainers in\ntheir own way. All fond memories now...\r
You’re one among those many Trainers.\nI’m sorry I wasn’t younger.\r
I am a Psychic, though I may not look\nlike one. I’ll do something psychic.
I didn’t use any psychic power to win.\nNo, really.\r
Did you notice? I was levitating while I\nwas in battle with you.\r
Fwazzam!\nSo! You are my next victim!
Fwazzam!\nHave you no spine?!\r
Fwizzle...\nDon’t think there will be a next time!
I can use psychic power, but I prefer\nordinary sleight-of-hand magic tricks.
It’s my opinion that psychic power\nshould be left to the Pokémon.\r
I’m a Psychic, but I’m also a student\nof a magician’s school.\r
In the next few minutes, you will learn\ntrue terror at my hands!
Hah! Too weak! Too weak!\nWhat pitiful resistance!\r
Noooo!\nI cannot lose!
I see what I have no right seeing...\nLike there. Behind you.
Oh? You can’t see it?\nThen, you’re fortunate. Giggle...\r
I wouldn’t ask about what I see.\nIt’s better not to know. Really.\r
The great unseeable power...\nI beseech you for help...
Oh, great unseeable power...\nI thank you for coming to my aid...\r
Oh... Great unseeable power...\nWhy have you forsaken me...\r
Why do I raise Pokémon?\nBecause they are there!
I think I said something deep and cool!\nDidn’t I?\r
That’s no reason at all?\nThat’s the reason in itself!\r
My team has been raised with care.\nI have absolute confidence in them.
You should pay closer attention to the\nunique aspects of your Pokémon.\r
How did you find my Pokémon?\nDid you notice their significance?\r
Everyone, it’s showtime!\nGet out and do some clobbering!
Oh, bravo!\nNicely won!\r
Arrgh! How humiliating!\nQuick! Out of the spotlight!\r
I love raising Pokémon.\nIt’s what I live for!
Seeing them try so hard to please...\nIt’s so unbearably adorable.\r
Don’t you dare do that again!\r
I’ve been devising ways of raising tough\nPokémon from the genetic level.
You can’t overlook the role of\nknowledge in raising tough Pokémon.\r
I need to study and understand what\ngenetics is about first.\r
Raise them with love, and Pokémon will\nanswer in kind. Probably.
They responded to my love.\nProbably.\r
You’re raising your Pokémon with a lot\nof love. I think.\r
I believe I will approach this battle\nfrom the perspective of a newborn.
Abuboo dah.\r
Ababaa.\nManmaa.\r
If you prevail, I’ll recount to you a\ntale from my youth.
Seeing you brings back a flood of\nmemories. Ah, yes, indeed...\r
...Hm?\nI seem to have forgotten...\r
There’s no end to either adolescence\nor Pokémon.
See ya! That was fun!\nEnjoy your youth!\r
I’m still a dreamer.\nA precious, unspoiled snowflake...\r
Daddy... Mommy... Can you hear me?\nPlease watch over me...
Daddy... Mommy... Did you see?\nI won, and it’s all for you...\r
Oh... Daddy... Mommy...\nI couldn’t win...\r
Finally... The time has come to put the\nfruits of my research to the test...
Success...\nSacrificing my youth was worthwhile.\r
No! Nooooooo!\nGive me back my youth!\r
I developed a special Pokémon drink.\nHave some! Bottoms up!
Glug, glug... Belch!\nIt’ll make you strong! Don’t waste it!\r
My Pokémon drink contains no actual\nPokémon or their byproducts.\r
An analogy for battling is...\nI’d say a bachelor guy.
Heheh, do you get it?\nI doubt you’d get it. No one does.\r
Do you get what I’m saying?\nI doubt you’d get it. No one ever does.\r
Myself, I have been born, raised, and\nspent my life under a circus tent.
My Pokémon, too. They were born and\nraised under a circus tent.\r
The outside world is so very cruel...\nWe shall return to our circus tent.
Oi, you! Yeah, you! Snap to it!\nI’ll be training you!
What?! You’re down and out already?!\nThis is no bed! Get up!\r
Good! Enough!\nThat will do for today!\r
Fwah? You mean to challenge me?
Fwahaha! I win!\nBetter luck next time, punk!\r
Fwaah?! You defeated me?\nWho are you to do that?!\r
Ooh, it gives me shivers...\nI live for this moment.
Oh, yeah... That’s it...\nPerfection doesn’t come better...\r
It’s gotten so I can’t live without\nbattling anymore.\r
OK! I’m going to do it!\nI’m going to show you my best!
Gasp, gasp...\r
Never again!\nYou can forget about a next time!\r
Um... I’m honestly quite tough.\nPlease keep up.
I’m sorry.\nI don’t think you measure up after all.\r
I’m amazed.\nI didn’t think you’d win...\r
Let’s go, me! Go, me, go!\nDon’t lose, don’t lose, rah, rah, rah!
Way to go, me! I’m so wonderful!\nRah, rah, rah! Gooooooo, me!\r
It’s OK, me! Don’t cry! Don’t cry!\nGo home, go home, goooooo!\r
Woohoo! Here comes a cool Trainer!\nLet’s see what you can bring!
Yes! Bravo!\nYou have some good attacks, Trainer!\r
Whaaaaat?! Nooooo!\nI can’t get over how tough you are!\r
To serve and protect Pokémon and\nnature. That’s my mission!
My skills I developed in the embrace of\nMother Nature!\r
My mission needs me!\nThis is where we bid good-bye!\r
Never fear, this Pokémon Ranger is\nhere to protect my own personal peace!
My personal peace has been protected!\r
You vile Trainer, you!\nYou’ve shattered my peace!\r
Any bad kids littering the fields?\nAny bad kids fouling the sea?
Be sure to sort your recyclables from\nthe trash when you’re throwing it out!
Trash is like a battle.\nDon’t be too quick to throw it!
Watch me, darling!\nI’m putting my best into this!
See, darling? Did you see?\nI put in my best effort for you.\r
I can’t have my darling see me like this.\nHow pathetic I must look...\r
So, I lead with this... Then, counter...\nUgh, I can’t get our strategy right!
To overanalyze can be a bad thing,\nI guess.\r
Waaah! Couldn’t you have waited?\nUntil I’m ready at least?\r
How do you like my cape?\nI had it specially made!
What is my cape made of?\nI’m afraid I can’t tell you.\r
Rip... Riiiiiiiiiiiipppppp!\n...What?! My cape! Waaaaah!\r
Do you know what real terror is?\nI am familiar with it. Intimately so...
You learned something today, yes?\nThe true meaning of terror.\r
Aiyeeh! What’s with you?\nI’m pleading for mercy here!\r
See it! Hear it! Smell it!\nMarvel at my power!
That’s right! Use all your senses and\nrealize what you were up against!\r
I didn’t see anything! I’m not\nlistening! And I don’t smell a thing!\r
Unluckily for you, your winning streak\nends with me.
You lost to me, but you’re still on\nyour feet. Kudos to you!\r
This can’t be. I won’t accept it.\nThere has to be a mistake somewhere.\r
I c-c-can’t stop shivering.\nB-but this is a b-battle. I have to.
Urrff... Ch-chatter...\nI won, I won...\r
Sh-shiver... Urf...\nMy eyelids are getting droopy...\r
I’ll say good-bye to you now.\nBattles always end in tears.
Fweeeeh!\nMy tears of joy flow freely!\r
Fweeeeh!\nMy tears of anguish flow freely!\r
How amusing! You came here knowing of\nyour certain defeat?
Ahahahah! Very entertaining!\nI shall be happy to see you again!\r
Wh-what is happening...?\nM-my vision is turning milky white...\r
A Trainer am I, a new ray of hope from\nthe land of the midnight sun.
In the frigid falls of the north, I honed\nmy skills. With them, I made you fall.\r
Your foul trickery deserves contempt.\nBut effective it was, too.\r
I’ve been pondering lately... How much\nlonger will I be wearing shorts?
Will I still be in shorts as a grown-up?\r
If I grow old like this, will they call me\nsomething silly like “Shorts Man”?\r
That’s right, I’m the legendary kid in\nshorts who’s the talk of the town.
Even a Youngster in shorts like me can\nbe the stuff of a legend or two.\r
My legend is over...\r
Uh... Um... H-hello.\nP-pleased to meet you.
S-s-sorry.\nI’m r-really n-nervous.\r
Uh... Th-thank you.\nThat was f-fun.\r
Oh, this place is so passé now.\nI’m missing out on shopping.
You’re kind of stylish, actually.\nOh, I wish I had new clothes.\r
Maybe I’ll collect Accessories for some\nContests...\r
Exam season’s coming up, but I’m\nneck-deep in battling...
Mom’s going to cut me off.\nI just know it...\r
I have to keep up on both my studying\nand Pokémon...\r
Hiya, you Trainer there! Slip on some\nglasses. They’ll make you look better.
Nothing’s the matter with my eyes.\nI wear glasses for the looks I get.\r
Whoops!\nMy glasses, my glasses.\r
I’ve been taught every opponent has\na weakness. If I can find yours...
Eheheh.\nI figured out your weakness.\r
Did you figure out my weakness?\r
It’s been so long since I had my\nlast battle.
You know, battling is fun after all.\r
Battling is so much fun, but...\r
The age of money has come to Pokémon\nbattling. I’ll teach you who is right.
You understand, don’t you?\nWhat is right, and who is stronger?\r
M-my Pokémon! What have you done?\nWhat am I to do?!\r
You’re my opponent? Oh, all right...\nTry not to disappoint me too badly.
My Pokémon are all tops in luxury.\nDo you see? This is what power is about.\r
Nyah! I don’t care! I’ve got enough \nmoney to fill a swimming pool!\r
You there. Yes, you.\nI’m feeling rather bored.
I suppose that was enjoyable for what\nit was. I thank you for it.\r
You are rather good.\nQuite remarkable, even.\r
I can sink your sort with minimal effort.
It took the barest of efforts to win\nthis match.\r
You swamped us with no effort at all...\r
My room is always full of bugs.\nThat drives my mom just wild.
I want to collect more bug Pokémon for\nmy bug appreciation station.\r
Bugs are loose under my shirt.\nI’m starting to itch...\r
People claim I’m like an adult. Whatever\ncould they mean, do you suppose?
Ah, yes, quite enjoyable!\nWe must do this again, surely.\r
Oh, yes! Smashing!\nThat chilled me to my toes, it did!\r
I have made my choice.\nWhen I fall, it shall be forward!
You lack conviction.\r
...Thud.\r
So, what exactly is a ninja,\nyou may ask.
A ninja is powerful.\nThat will do as a start.\r
Maybe some ninjas are weak?\r
I once saw a lady wearing the same\noutfit as me.
She said, “You’re showing serious\nfashion chops.”\r
She said, “You’re kidding me,\nam I right?”\r
Will you believe that inside this\ncostume is a grown-up Beauty?
My dream is to live as a Pokémon\none day. To become a Pokémon!\r
I’m an adult, but I want to be a\nPokémon. Does that make me weird?\r
My profile’s riding high now, so my\nschedule’s filled solid!
Oh, no! It’s this late already?\nI’d better check my timetable!\r
Talent manager!\nDo I have time for a rematch?\r
Are you another of my fans? I can give\nyou an autograph if you’d lose?
Here’s your autograph! Cherish it!\nOh, sorry! I don’t do handshakes.\r
I’m sorry, I was acting GASTLY!\nIt was very DELCATTY of me!\r
I need to diet.\nI have to get out jogging.
Well, I guess I’ll go for a quick trot\naround here...\r
Your Pokémon know how to punch hard.\nYou see, I’m really a boxer.\r
I look to bug Pokémon for hints on\nrunning all the time.
I admire the light and agile footwork of\nbug Pokémon.\r
Skitter...\r
Listen, I’m feeling bushed today.\nCan we do this tomorrow first thing?
Oh, all right. You’re impatient.\nCouldn’t wait till tomorrow, oh no.\r
That’s why I said tomorrow.\nI can barely stay awake now.\r
Feed the Pokémon you catch, or they\nwill flee. Do you see?
Once a Pokémon has fled, it will never\nreturn. Do you see?\r
What I said about Pokémon--it is a\nparable. Do you see?\r
When I was younger, I went out on digs\nchasing rumors of hidden treasures.
Of course, there are no such things.\nBut it’s about chasing a dream.\r
Well, it sure left huge holes...\nIn the ground and in my bank account.\r
I’ll launch an avalanche of moves!\nI’ll test your limits of endurance!
Well, Trainer?\nShould I try out some more moves?\r
That’s it! I’m all out of stock!\nI’d like you to leave so I can close up!\r
I collect and battle Pokémon so I can\nbrag to my peers.
I’m not all that interested in winning\nor losing to begin with.\r
You’ve won the battle. But, in terms of\nthe Pokémon involved, I clearly win.
Did you want to see my Pokémon?\nOK, sure. Just a peek, though.
How’s that for classy? My Pokémon are\ntops in both moves and character.\r
Hold it right there!\nYou can look, but don’t touch!\r
Rock? Samba? Traditional folk?\nI can play in any style. It’s all good!
Music and Pokémon uplift me!\nI’m carried up among the stars!\r
Sigh... I’m seeing stars...\nYou’ve got me singing the blues...\r
Let my exquisite melody ring out!\nHear my Pokémon shout out!
The melody from my Pokémon and me...\nDid it reach out and touch your heart?\r
I’ve been known to throw matches, but\nI’ll never throw a guitar on stage!\r
I’m free like a bird!\nI feel like I could fly!
That’s how I ended up becoming a\nBird Keeper.\r
Like most birds, I can’t see very well\nat night.\r
As a Trainer, I’m as fragile as an egg.\nPlease be gentle on me.
Do you think I’m getting ready to\ntake flight?\r
One of these days, I’ll break out of my\nshell and defeat you.\r
Bear witness to my display of machismo\nand masculinity!
There!\nThat’s how a real man lives and battles!\r
Waaaah! Waaaah!\nMommy!\r
I’ve got a showdown coming up with a\nHiker. Let me see if I’m ready!
Yep, I’d say my team’s about ready.\nThat Hiker won’t know what hit him!\r
Aww, blast it, no!\nI can’t beat that Hiker like this!\r
My showdown against a man of the sea\ndraws near! Let me test my team!
Everything went as calculated...\nBe ready for me, man of the sea!\r
Beating the man of the sea is impossible\nwith an outcome this lame...\r
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nThis dance I use to psych myself up.
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nSo much fun, I cannot stop.\r
Uhho uho-uho uhho hohoi!\nI dance to stem my tears from losing...\r
I’m not really with the police.\nI’m a collector of uniforms.
Battling as a Policeman made for a very\nfun battle, it did.\r
That’s it for me.\nI bid you a fond farewell.\r
I’m a Policeman. But on holidays, I’m\nan entirely different kind of guy.
Usually, I chase after bad guys as\na Policeman.\r
On my days off, I chase after the waves\nand the ladies as a Swimmer.\r
Perseverance pays off.\nA case can turn on that.
It makes for more excitement when you\ncome from behind to take the win.\r
That was more thrilling than any\nstakeout! Thanks for that!\r
My present case can go either way.\nIt’s a coin toss.
So, I won this time...\nAll decided by a fickle coin...\r
Best two out of three?\r
I live in the woods.\nYou know, I’m a Camper.
I’m working on making camp life more\ncomfortable.\r
I am sick and tired of camping out in\nthe woods...\r
No, no, I can’t do this!\nI’m not cut out for battling!
Oh, wow! I won! What’ll I do?\nYou’re not mad at me, are you?\r
See! I told you before we started!\nBattling just isn’t for me.\r
Trainer spotted!\nIt’s time to get cooking!
A battle should be enjoyed like a\ntasty meal!\r
I ended up getting cooked!\r
Fweeoo-fwee-fwee-fyoo...\nI saunter into battle, whistling...
Too easy! I was whistling all the way\nthrough that.\r
Fwee-ooo fwee-ooo fwee-ooo...\nI switched to an ambulance siren...\r
I can hear it... The screaming adulation\nof 100,000 fans rising in unison...
Right on, everyone! You saw that!\nI dedicate my win to you!\r
You’re scorching...\nYou’ve made a fan out of me.\r
Number one worldwide, that’s my dream.\nWell, to start, anyway.
“Number one worldwide,” now doesn’t\nthat have a good ring to it?\r
I can’t quite decide what I should be\nnumber one worldwide at.\r
I’m not some cheap Idol!\nI’m an actress! Please remember that!
My career isn’t anything like your\ntypical Idol’s career!\r
I’m an actress...\nIt sounds so deliciously right...\r
We’re not here for a long time, so let’s\nmake it a good time!
Thank you! That was soooo fun!\nI really hope we can battle again!\r
It makes me sad having to say\ngood-bye... Please come see me again!\r
I am the Fan Club Division Manager...\nBring your best to bear...
Kneel before the might of the Fan Club!\r
Gweh! But I did my best!\nRegrets, I have none!\r
I welcome you, young Trainer.\nAllow me to demonstrate my power.
Young Trainer, do you have any idea\nwhat my power signifies?\r
You’ve surpassed me in your love of\nPokémon. You’re the truest of fans.\r
I think I’ll try out the TM the woman\nnext door gave me.
I am impressed. That woman actually\ngave me something useful.\r
Oh, that nasty woman!\nThis TM is worthless!\r
I heard that! I may be old enough to be\nyour mom, but I’m still young!
Look at my skin tone and my Pokémon!\nBoth firm but supple!\r
Please don’t make that mistake again!\nI’m young, I tell you!\r
Whether it be work or play, I’m with my\nPokémon all day.
Life without Pokémon?\nI can’t picture that.\r
It’s like I’m married to my Pokémon.\nI’m not married, though.\r
You get to be the best by working\nharder than everyone else.
I reckon I’ve been a hard worker.\r
Work at battling over and over.\nYour star will shine one day.\r
I’m going to become famous here so I\ncan rebuild the ranch.
I can’t lose.\nIt’s for my pa and ma.\r
If I can get famous, folks’ll pay to\nvisit my ranch...\r
From sundown, I live by candlelight\nuntil I go to sleep.
That’s not to say I don’t have electric\npower on the homestead.\r
Candlelight can be very romantic.\r
I’d like to introduce you to my\ncherished partners.
Good, good. Good going, gang.\nYou guys all did great.\r
Wheeze... Wheeze...\nI’m feeling faint...\r
I’m no green thumb at growing Berries.\nRaising Pokémon is where I shine.
I can give you tips on raising Pokémon\nso they’ll grow tough.\r
Raising a living thing is never an\neasy job...\r
Pokémon are Pokémon, no matter how\ntough, weak, cute, or scary.
Raise Pokémon with love, and they’ll\nreturn it.\r
I think it’s the Trainer who needs to\npick up the pace here.\r
Raising a Pokémon right takes money\nand time.
But it’s all worthwhile when the\nPokémon grows up.\r
To raise the ideal Pokémon,\nI’m willing to work hard.\r
That’s right, I’m tough. I won’t lose.\nI don’t think losing’s possible.
Yup, I’m so tough...\nEhehe... Heeheehee...\r
I lost? But, how...?\nWhat now? What do I do?\r
I’m an Ace Trainer, so this is for\nbragging rights.
Yup, you did good.\nNo, seriously.\r
Heh...\nI’ve got a long ways to go...\r
I was looking forward to a battle\nwith you!
I was right! You are pretty decent.\nWhy not become an Ace Trainer?\r
You’re as good as the rumors say...\nMay I have a rematch one day?\r
Look at me.\nI’m what you should be aspiring to be.
You expected anything else?\r
You’ve already surpassed me.\nBut you can aim so much higher.\r
My whole life hinges on this one battle!\n...Lose for me, pretty please?
Yeah! I won!\nIt’s all smooth sailing for me now!\r
I wasn’t supposed to lose...\nThat’s my life derailed...\r
I’m running a fever here.\nJust so’s you know.
Oogh, my head’s burning up.\nIt makes me feel more inspired.\r
Like I said, I have a cold.\nI’m not on top of my game.\r
When we battle, I want you to be very\ncareful. My coat’s very expensive.
Yikes! Eek! Watch out! You almost got\nPokémon sweat on my coat!\r
I was worried about getting my coat\ndirty. Who cares about your battle?\r
I wish you’d leave.\nI don’t want to see you lose.
I told you so...\nCan you leave, please?\r
Listen...is being tough not always a\ngood thing?\r
Whoa-whoa-whoa... Careful now!\nMaintaining balance is the key!
Whoops...! Almost went over!\nHave to be careful here...\r
...Waaaaaah...\nThud!\r
Now don’t you worry about a thing.\nYou leave everything to me, OK?
What do you say? Fun, hey?\nIt’d be nice if we could meet again.\r
Well, I’ll be!\nYou sure got the best of me!\r
I will battle. It’s not likely I will lose.\nI’m tough.
I win.\nI could do a dance right now.\r
What is the matter?\nWhy couldn’t I win?\r
Mother Nature, I beseech you!\nPlease, lend me strength!
Oh, Mother Nature, I thank you!\nTo you, I dedicate this victory!\r
I’m sorry, Mother Nature!\nI’m sorry to disappoint you!\r
A good Trainer takes on all challenges\nregardless of the foe or the rules.
No Trainer can be considered bad if\nthey battle the best they can.\r
A good Trainer doesn’t gloat over a win.\nThey just prepare for the next battle.\r
Come hither, my Pokémon!\nPlease get rid of this mean Trainer!
Ooh, yes, I love you, my sweeties!\rCome here and give me a kiss!
How could you?!\nYou hurt my sweet little ones!\r
I’m fine with practice and training, but\nI wilt when the chips are down.
I feel sick from tension!\nI’d rather be at home practicing!\r
If it’s about practice, I’d be the\nchamp without a doubt.\r
Hi-yah! Hah! Hah!\nOne more! Hah! Hah!
Boo-yah!\r
Hi-yah! ...No, wait!\nNo!\r
Wanna?
Heh...\r
You beat me?\nWhere’s your dojo?\r
Come oooon! C’mon, c’mon!\nHey! Hey! C’mon, hey!
Oh, yesssss!\r
Oh, noooooo!\r
Your eyes are unclouded by doubt.\nThis match will be entertaining...
From the bottom of my heart, I look\nforward to your return.\r
Whew... A most entertaining match.\nI hope you’ll grant me a rematch.\r
You need to be taught what wisdom of\nage means in battle!
I’ll have you know that no child can\nhope to defeat me!\r
That did not happen! Unfair!\nI demand a rematch right now!\r
I’m feeling cranky today!\nHelp me get my mind off it!
Whew... A battle is the perfect\nstress reliever!\r
Eeeeeeeeh!\nYou’ve pushed me over to furious!\r
Cue battle music, please!\nI want to trumpet my victory!
I love the battle music.\nIt sets my heart racing.\r
Fine, that will do.\nBack to the regular theme music.\r
When you’ve been a Trainer as long as\nI have, let’s just say you’ll see a lot.
Things like this happen.\nDon’t let it get you down.\r
People and Pokémon are all different.\nIsn’t that what makes it beautiful?
My big brother told me to go for the\neyes! Aim for the eyes!
I did it, big brother!\r
My big brother told me to wreck the\nother Trainer’s accuracy!\r
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey clamor to battle...
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey call for your return...\r
I hear my Pokémon calling out...\nThey tell me of the fun they had...\r
Behind you, I see light.\nWhat is its significance?
I thought I saw an aura of invincibility.\nI must have been mistaken.\r
Now I see...\nYou glow with the light of victory...\r
I’ll deliver defeat to you elegantly\nand speedily.
Thank you for your patience!\r
I’m so terribly sorry.\nI ended up with your intended defeat.\r
Great, another tough-looking Trainer.\nThe fun never ends for me.
Bleah, that was too close for comfort.\nNothing ever comes easy for me.\r
Yeah, see? I knew I’d lose.\nIf only that move landed...\r
Everyone has too much to say about\nPokémon! If it’s fun, that’s enough!
Excuse me, but are you all right?\nMaybe you’re a little too tired?\r
If you get too caught up in winning and\nlosing, you’ll burn yourself out.\r
Aren’t you the cutest guest! You can\nexpect the best service from me!
Well, were you impressed by the level\nof service I provided?\r
Oh, wait, please!\nI’m not done serving you!\r
I keep a journal about the lives of the\nTrainers who arrive here.
In our vast world, I wonder how many\nTrainers will cross my path?\r
Every encounter ends in parting.\nThat’s why I keep a journal.\r
I’ve waited all my life for someone like\nyou. I’m never letting you go.
It was a ploy to confuse you with\nwords out of some romance movie.\r
Now, go on, don’t let me hold you back.\nSeize your chance at happiness!\r
Will you give me an interview if you win?
You made my job too easy.\nYou need to buckle down.\r
Your feelings now, in a word!\nShout it into the mike, please!\r
I’m on a diet...\nI’m so famished...
I’m happy, but if I get excited, I’ll get\nhungry. No thanks...\r
Oh...\nYour Pokémon look delicious...\r
Let me make it clear right now, I’m\ntougher than you can stand!
See?\nI wasn’t exaggerating!\r
Who are you exactly?!\r
Clear the way! Out of the way!\nWait! Don’t go! We have to battle!
Come on, take it up a gear!\nKeep up with me!\r
OK, out of the way! Clear the way!\nLet this loser run away!\r
Safe driving and safer battling.\nThat’s my motto.
You can be patient in a battle.\nVictory will come eventually.\r
I’ll keep to my own pace.\nI’ll catch up to you one day.\r
I only have this Bike to look good for\nthe guys. I can’t actually ride.
It was a pain getting this Bike here.\nI had to push it all the way!\r
I’m only concerned about looking good.\nI don’t practice enough.\r
I’m not looking for any excitement.\nI don’t need any drama.
A battle is all the excitement I need.\r
I recently realized that I’m not cut\nout for this scary job.\r
I’ll battle my way.\nYou battle yours.
People are people.\nI’ll go my own way.\r
People are people.\nYou go your own way.\r
Today, I have a special treat for all\nmy fans!
Thank you!\nI love your support!\r
Are you really one of my fans?\r
I’m burnt out on being an Idol.\nI want to go home to the country...
I can’t quit now!\nKids dream of being me!\r
I miss hearing my mother’s voice...\r
I’m one of a kind.\nThat’s what I’m saying.
I keep it real.\nThat’s what makes me tough.\r
I kept it real, but you won anyway.\nYour reality was more real.\r
Hi! Are you my next opponent?\nLet’s keep it clean and fair!
It feels great going all out with no\ndirty tricks.\r
That was an awesome workout!\nWe have to do this again sometime!\r
My needs are simple.\nFishing and Moomoo Milk are all I need.
Winning or losing isn’t something I pay\nheed to.\r
I could use some Moomoo Milk right\nabout now.\r
You there! Take a look at the Pokémon\nI fished up the other day.
I can tell you’re impressed. This guy,\nI don’t know how long it took to land.\r
A word of advice: when an older person\nis bragging, pretend to be interested.\r
You’re a Trainer.\nLet your Pokémon do the talking.
Where’s your spirit?\nThat didn’t speak to me at all.\r
Great! Great!\nYour feelings came across!\r
Here comes your prey!\nGet ’em! Chaaaarge!
Gaahahaha!\nThat’s it! Good job!\r
We’re outmatched!\nPull back, guys! Run away!\r
Bring it on!\nOoooh! Haaah!
Thank you kindly!\r
Thanks for having me!\r
I am captivated by the mountains.\nThey’re the main thing in my life!
The mountains mean more to me\nthan any battle, no matter how fun!\r
Your battle skills are impressive, but I\ncan’t wait to return to the mountains.\r
We’re going to hammer you, kid.\nDon’t freeze up and close your eyes.
I like how you stay defiant even after\nlosing. Good attitude, kid.\r
Honest, I didn’t let up one bit or let\ndown my guard because you’re a kid.\r
I battle around the globe.\nI’m a worldwide bad boy!
I don’t lose at battling.\nI can’t get over how cool I am!\r
I’m hitting the road over that loss.\nIt’s good-bye to the old me!\r
Battles, I’m good at.\nBut musical aptitude? Forget it.
This whole battling thing is good, but\nI wish I could play music as well.\r
Music or Pokémon...\nIt’s a tough choice.\r
I wrote a song using the cries of\nPokémon. I’d like you to hear it.
Graaah wagyaaah! Wagyaaaah!\nChu! Chu! Gyaroooh-gah!\r
Giiyaaaah! Drundundun!\nGaroo-gah! Wawawaaah!\r
I’m bored of collecting and hoarding.\nI’m getting rid of everything now.
There’s nothing that I really want now.\nMaybe I’ll become a clown...
I threw the match for a start.\nIt’s nice to be unburdened of things.
Oh! Hold on a second!\nIncoming text message!
Ticka-ticka-ticka... Ticka-tick...\nHuh? Is it over already?\r
Hey, stop that!\nNo peeking at my text messages!\r
There’s no meaning to this battle!\nPokémon should be about love!
Battling leaves me empty.\nHug your Pokémon and show your love!\r
Battling creates nothing.\nHug your Pokémon and show your love!\r
Are you challenging me? ...You are.\nKids these days...
Now run along home, and go help your\nmommy with her chores!\r
Hey, you... If you think playtime will\nlast forever, you’ll end up like me.\r
How will you counter my implacable logic?
Everything according to calculation...\nThis victory is a complete one.\r
You outcalculated me.\nI’m incredulous.\r
I’ve been ensconced in the lab.\nMy shoulders are all knotted up.
What a refreshing break!\nI’m feeling loose and relaxed now.\r
My Pokémon and I, we all need to get\noutside and exercise more.\r
Hmmm... So young...\nI may have to go easy...
You’re so depressingly young...\nIt’s fine. You may go.\r
Consider the loser’s feelings.\nThat’s where you young people fail...\r
You see an old man, yes?\nDon’t be fooled by the way I look.
I find it abhorrent to lose to any\nyoung Trainer.\r
I was fooled by your youth.\nFoolish, foolish me...\r
As a Worker, it’s my job to both build\nand demolish.
Why don’t you become a Worker, too?\nI find it fun and rewarding.\r
Making things is harder than\ndemolishing, but it’s more satisfying.\r
You and your Pokémon, I’ll clean up on\nyou easily.
Well, well, how pathetic was that.\nTake your passengers and go home.\r
Gwaah... So heavy...\nMy guys buckled under the load.\r
Outstanding athleticism and a great\nsense of humor; that’s a clown!
A clown is a job of greatness.\nOnly the chosen can become one!\r
The ability to laugh off disappointment\nis another requirement for a clown!\r
Laugh with the face and cry with the\nheart; that’s how a clown lives.
Ahahahahaha!\r
Gah! ...Ahahahaha!\r
Oi, listen! I’m a Policeman, sure, but a\nTrainer before that!
What?\nA Policeman can’t lose his temper?\r
Yes, I’m a Policeman, but I have dreams\nand aspirations, and, and... Snivel...\r
Hands up! Put ’em where I can see ’em!\nYou’re all under arrest!
Case closed!\r
This is a gross miscarriage of justice!\r
I’ll have you know that I’m an\nInternet detective.
My powers of observation and\nlogic prevailed!\r
Think you’ve outsmarted me?\nMaybe this was just a sting operation!\r
Wherever, whenever, and with whomever.\nThat’s my motto!
When, where, or whom...\nIt doesn’t matter at all to me.\r
Hahaha! This is great!\nI want to keep this going!\r
The loser has to pretend to be a\nSTUNKY, OK?
Giggle, you lose.\nI want to see your STUNKY impression!\r
OK, here’s my STUNKY impression!\nThree, two, one...\r
A good breeze has sprung up...\nThis is good! I can win this!
The tailwind put us over the top!\n...As they say!\r
The headwind worked against us!\n...As they say!\r
Even though I always have my parasol\nup, I actually like sunny days.
I hope it will be sunny tomorrow...\r
The heavy downpour in my heart...\nWhen will it ever stop...?\r
My, you’re very eager to go. I’d better\ntake the tension up a notch, too!
I had a lot of fun with that match!\nWouldn’t it be nice to see you again!\r
You’re so full of energy!\nWhy, I feel energized, too!\r
How much longer do I have to wait for a\nTrainer that’s any good?
I’m so bored by the weak competition.\nMaybe I’ll just retire.\r
Oh, hello, there.\nNow, you’re a little special.\r
My ladylike charms don’t mean a thing\nto a little kid...
That was too close for comfort!\nIt doesn’t pay to underestimate foes.\r
Battling fair and square doesn’t appeal\nto me. I’d rather win.\r
Like everything else, people have likes\nand dislikes when it comes to scents.
I love how Pokémon smell after a battle.\r
I feel a little thrill if I catch a whiff\nof intense effort postbattle.\r
Sniff, sniff... Yes! Here it comes!\nAroma power!
With aroma power, I’m invincible!\r
Fizzle...\nI’m out of aroma power...\r
Turn, step, turn, turn... I’ll practice\nmy dance steps while battling!
I dance with passion and precision.\nHow can there be a weakness?\r
You’re throwing off my rhythm!\nMy dance routine is ruined!\r
I’m always ready for the public eye.\nYou can come at me at your own pace.
That’s why people consider me the\nperfect Idol.\r
I didn’t know how bad it feels to lose.\nThis is a first for me.\r
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic!\nDo come again!\r
I have no problem with losing to a\nspectacular Trainer like you!\r
   
Ah, wonderful! That was fantastic!\nDo come again!\r
I have no problem with losing to a\nspectacular Trainer like you!\r
What Pokémon do you want up on stage?\nI can’t wait!
That was a most enjoyable time!\nThank you! Come again, please.\r
Oh... I detest how fun times seem to\nend so quickly.\r
What Pokémon do you want to show off\nthis time?\fI can’t wait!
How wonderful that was!\nThank you! Come again, please.\r
It’s so sad how the truly fun times\nseem to last only a moment.\r
It doesn’t matter what you throw at\nme. I’ll always win.\rMy investigative and analytical system\nis truly amazing.
See?\nJust as analyzed.\r
Whoa!\nYou sure showed me!\r
It doesn’t matter what you throw at\nme. I’ll always win.\rI’ll stake my investigative and\nanalytical system on it!
See?\nJust as analyzed.\r
Whoa!\nYou sure showed me!\r
Always be smiling!\nLuck comes to those who are happy!\rThat’s why I always keep a big smile and\nbelieve in my Pokémon when I battle.
You’re very good!\nI had a lot of fun!\r
You’re so very, very good!\nMy Pokémon had a good time, too!\r
Whenever I battle someone tough,\nI smile. I cannot help it!\rHow about you? What do you do?\nDo you laugh? Cry? Get angry?
Win or lose, whenever I battle someone\nwonderful, I am happy!\r
Battling a wonderful Trainer is always\na happy occasion!\r
Very well...\nShall we begin?
Ah, a most valiant effort.\rThough I was lucky enough to win this\ntime, the next time...\r
My Pokémon could not be faulted in any\nway, shape, or form.\rMy hat’s off to you.\r
This is for Lady Caitlin’s sake.\nI’m afraid I must go all out.
Ah, a most valiant effort.\rThough I was lucky enough to win this\ntime, the next time...\r
Your skills are superlative as ever!\nMy admiration knows no bounds.\r
