Well, that was a very interesting\nbattle now, wasn’t it?\rWhen I’m fishing here, I sometimes\ncatch items that people have dropped.\fIf I find anything, I’ll give it to you.\rWill you give me your\nphone number? {YESNO 0}
If I snag anything good, I’ll be sure to\nlet you know.
All right... Come back if you have a\nchange of heart.
If I snag an item while I’m fishing,\nit’s yours. Trade me numbers? {YESNO 0}
Ah! Here it is!\rCome on!\nI caught a Poké Ball!\rIt’s kind of covered with algae and\nseaweed. I can’t really tell what kind\fof Poké Ball it is, but I bet you know!\r
Shhh!!!\nThe POLIWHIRL will run away!\rDon’t bother calling me, come talk to me\nin person, that way we can whisper!
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}’s grown impressive!\nMy fishing skills have improved, too!\rWe beat a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}...\nYou know, I have more fun fishing\fthan beating wild Pokémon.\rAll right, later.
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}’s grown impressive!\nMy fishing skills have improved, too!\rBut some time ago, we came this close\nto landing a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}.\fI tell you, it was huge. Believe me.\rAll right, later.
I’m fishing on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}, but\nnothing’s biting today.\rHelp me while my time away--come over\nfor a battle.
Sigh...They’re not biting like before on\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}...\rYou have to come for a battle!
Nah, I haven’t found anything that’s\nworth your time.\rYou have to have patience.
I snagged an item while fishing.\nCome pick it up on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!
Don’t you want this item?\nHah? You don’t know where?\r{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}...\nJust head from Mahogany toward\fBlackthorn!
