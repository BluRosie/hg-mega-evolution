You...\nYou think I’m cool right?\rSo how about we exchange phone\nnumbers? {YESNO 0}
Don’t worry, you can call me anytime!
Oh, I see...\nMaybe I was overthinking things...
I knew it! I knew you’d think I\nwas cool!\rSo, shall we trade phone\nnumbers now? {YESNO 0}
You must be really shy.\nIf you’re nearby, you can come talk to\fme in person. It’s all right.
My prized {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is doing great.\rWhich Pokémon do you like best?\nYou should show me sometime.
Hey, listen up!\nYesterday we were fighting a wild\f{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}.\rI thoughtlessly used a Potion at the\nwrong moment, and it looked like we were\fgoing to lose.\rMy Pokémon worked so hard. I really\nwanted to win, you know?\rWell, those kinds of things happen,\nI guess.
Do you keep all the Pokémon you\ncapture in PC Boxes?\rMe, I usually just let them go...\rThat reminds me, I recently let this\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} go...\rThat’s kind of a waste, isn’t it?
Hey, what do you think about battling\nwith me again?\rI’m at the {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}\nright now.\rCome on over!
Hello?\nDo you remember your promise?\rWe have to battle soon!\nI’ll be at the {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}.
It wasn’t a very smart move to come to\nthe Park in a miniskirt, was it...?\rI mean, these leaves keep scratching\nmy legs...
