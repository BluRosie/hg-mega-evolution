They built the new Radio Tower to\nreplace the old, creaky one.
Have you visited the Pokéathlon Dome?\nIt is a huge sports facility where\fPokémon compete with each other.\rIt was quite a sight!
I know there’s a new Bike Shop,\nbut I can’t find it anywhere.
The fact that you have a Bike...\nmeans you got it from a Bike Shop,\fright?\rAll right!\nI can say that there is a Bike Shop\fsomewhere in this city!
Is that man in black dressed up\nlike a Team Rocket member?\fHow silly!
Was that man in black really part\nof Team Rocket?\fI can’t believe it!
The Radio Tower in Goldenrod City is\na landmark.\rThey’re running a promotional campaign\nright now.\rThey’ll modify your Pokégear so it can\nalso serve as a radio.

E-he-he-he...\nI got in trouble for playing in the\fbasement of the department store.
The man at that tent rates your\nPokémon names.\rHe can even rename your Pokémon.
I think I’ll give my Pokémon cool\nnicknames as a reward if they do\fwell in the Pokéathlon.
Whew! This is one big town.\nI don’t know where anything is.
I know that you can find the\nPokéathlon Dome when you take\fRoute 35 north and go past the\fleft gate...\rBut I seem to get lost every time\nI come to this town...
So this is the Radio Tower...\r
What do you want, you pest?\nScram!\r
What are you doing?\nGet to your position right away!\r
Pokémon? They’re nothing more than\ntools for making money!
We are on guard here.\nDon’t you worry!
Take over the Radio Tower...\rWhat? It’s none of your business!
You look awfully young...\nAre you new?
Hey, brat! You don’t belong here!\fGet lost!
Hey, hey!\nI’ve got this covered!\rWhy don’t you go to the Radio Tower?
Friendship with Pokémon?\rThat makes me laugh!
Our dream will soon come true...\nIt was such a long struggle...
Who are you? A newcomer?\rWe’ve run out of Team Rocket\nuniforms.\rOne of my guys is going to get more...\rWhat’s taking him so long?\rThe studio in the tunnel is just around\nthe corner.
For a young one like you to decide\nto become a member of Team Rocket...\fThat’s great, kiddo!
Get out of my way!\rWe, as Gym Trainers, will never allow\nTeam Rocket to do nasty things here\fin our city!
Tee hee!\rYou Gym Trainers can be a problem.\nStay in the Gym and stay out of\fthe way!
The Gym Leader, Whitney, went flying by\nsaying, “I have got to\fget a Radio Card!”
Wh-what are you trying to do?\nCan’t you see this cool, pitch-black\funiform I’m wearing?\rYou’re not afraid of Team Rocket? Huh?
You don’t appear scary enough to be a\nTeam Rocket member in that uniform...\fMake a scarier face and say, “Yeee!”\rAll the while, clenching your teeth!
Where do you think you’re going?\nWe are right in the middle of\fthe mission!
Where do you think you are going?\nThe Radio Tower is not here!
The GTS lets you trade Pokémon\nall over the world!\r...Except that we have something\nmore important to do right now!
If you love to trade so much, wait until\nthe Radio Tower mission is over.\rThen you’ll have plenty of time!
Slow down!\rI’m the only one who was sent here.\fDon’t give me any more trouble, OK?\r
