Hey!\nTrade phone numbers with\fme, old buddy! {YESNO 0}
Call me sometime!\nI’ll call you sometimes, too!\n
No way!
Hey, hey!\nThis time, let’s get our phone\fnumbers traded, old buddy! {YESNO 0}
Wah ha ha! {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\nHere’s that Dawn Stone you wanted.\rHere you go.\r...And now that you’ve got what you\ncame here for, SCRAM!\r
It’s dangerous to talk on the phone\nwhile riding on Cycling Road, but\fsometimes I’ve got no choice!\rIf you’re nearby, let’s talk in person!
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} has gotten way strong!\rIt knocked out a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} in,\nlike, two seconds!\fWahahahahahahaha!\r...What?\nYou think I’m exaggerating?\rPut a lid on it! Nothing but truth!
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} has gotten\nawesomely strong!\rWe can go catch {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} now!
Recently, I came across a wild\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} on the road.\rSuddenly, out it jumps! I fell off\nmy Bike trying not to hit it!\rBut it’s all good, even though I got a\nlittle scraped up.\rIt’s all good ’cause I like to be nice to\nwild Pokémon!
Hey! Right now, I’m\non {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!\rDon’t run, don’t hide, just get over\nhere and fight me!
Listen! Here I wait on good old\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!\rTime for us to have another battle,\nfair and square, so come alone!\rWait...\nBring your Pokémon with you!\fWithout a Pokémon, we can’t battle!
You...\nYou’ve got a Pokémon with you, right?\rThat’s...\nThat’s pretty sweet, isn’t it?\rIf you were blazing up and down the\nroad as fast as you could, like me, you\fwouldn’t be able to have your Pokémon\falongside you.\rMakes me a bit jealous of you, to tell\nthe truth.
Hey! I picked up something great!\rI checked it with someone who knows\nthis stuff. They said it’s a Dawn Stone.\rIf you want it, I’m on\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}, so come and get it!
Listen! Pick up the pace and pick up\nthis Dawn Stone! On {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!
