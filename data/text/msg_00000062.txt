Only one Pokémon can Stroll with you\nin a Pokéwalker...\rI can’t decide which one!
I may not look like it, but I have\nmany Pokéwalkers on me!\fThey make loud noises as I walk.\rMaybe taking a Stroll isn’t as easy as\nI thought...
Pay attention, please!\r...Oops, I have to quit thinking like\na teacher all the time.\rYou must be a Pokémon Trainer.\rSince you’re working so hard,\nI want you to have this.\r
                     
Let a Pokémon hold that Quick Claw.\rSometimes it will strike first\nduring battle.
It’s fun having a Pokémon out of its\nPoké Ball to walk with it,\fbut the Pokéwalker is a whole\fnew dimension.
My mom can’t take my Pokémon and tells\nme not to play with it indoors.\fBut, hey!\rI can keep it in my Pokéwalker.\nThat way, I’m always with it!
I take walks in the park, but I\nnever go into the grass.\rTrainers always want to battle...
PERSIAN: Fufushaa!
Huff, puff, huff...\rI am...out of...breath!\nI’ve been running to try\fand charge the Pokéwalker!

Don: Whether you get the right Pokémon\nor not is half luck.
                                           
                                              
Ed: The size of the Pokémon is not the\nonly thing to compare when trying to\fdecide the winner.
                                
                               
Abby: Somebody told me that colorful\nPokémon are more likely to win.\fI wonder if it’s true...
                            
                                             
William: I got the Pokémon I wanted,\nso I’m very happy.
                                              
                                              
Benny: You know what?\nI caught a SCYTHER the other day,\fand I still didn’t win...
                                             
                                              
Barry: You have a better chance to win\nwhen your Pokémon is at a high level.\fBut it seems that there is more\fto winning.
                           
                        
Cindy: I love Bug-type Pokémon.\rAm I repeating myself?

Samuel: Arrgh! I though it would\nscore higher.
                           
                                                 
Kipp: Studying hard on Bug-type\nPokémon doesn’t ensure you’ll win here.
