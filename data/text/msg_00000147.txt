Cynthia: My name is Cynthia.\nI am a Pokémon Trainer.\rThe {COLOR 1}Sinjoh Ruins{COLOR 0} remind me of Sinnoh,\nwhere I come from.\rInitially, I thought it was because\nit snows a lot here as well.\rBut that was not it.\rA long time ago...people came from\nSinnoh to live here.\rThey must have built a temple here\nwhile longing for home.\rThat’s why we call these the\n{COLOR 1}Sinjoh Ruins{COLOR 0}...\r
Cynthia: You are...\fa Pokémon Trainer?\rI can sense strong power coming\nfrom your Poké Ball...\r
Cynthia: I wouldn’t assume you managed\nto get here by yourself.\rThis is a heavy-snowfall area where\nthe snowbound land freezes you\fto the core...\rTalk to the old man if you wish to go\nback. ABRA should be able to take you\fwhere you come from.
Cynthia: I feel a familiar presence...\nThe power of DIALGA...\fPALKIA...\for could it be GIRATINA?\rIt’s similar, but not quite the same...\r
Cynthia: Have you got time?\rCan you come to the {COLOR 1}Sinjoh Ruins{COLOR 0}\nwith me?\rCall it a Trainer’s intuition.\rWhen you and your Pokémon step onto\nthat stage, something will happen.\r
     
Cynthia: The snowbound ruins make\nme wonder...\rTime and space change, and we with\nthem. We leave some things behind\fand give each other company...\rSinnoh, Johto...\nWhen you feel you’re close to\funderstanding the whole world,\fyou are merely drowning in your\fown miniscule perception.\r
A long time ago, people used to draw\nlife from Pokémon and also give their\flives to those Pokémon...\rThat shows that people and Pokémon\nused to be more closely bonded with\feach other.\rWhen people moved from place to place,\nthe myths and legends of Pokémon\fand their power would also be carried\fwith those people.\rThat’s how myths and legends from each\nregion are blended with each other.\rThe ancient ruins here have inherited\nthe legends from both the {COLOR 1}Ruins of Alph{COLOR 0}\fin Johto and the {COLOR 1}Spear Pillar{COLOR 0} in Sinnoh.\rThat is proof that people from Johto\nand Sinnoh blended together\fas a group.
ARCEUS is said to have come out of\nan Egg.\rJohto people believe that Pokémon Eggs\nare the vessels of life, and thus\fsomething astounding.\rPlaces far from each other can share\nsimilar myths and legends...\rThat’s quite interesting, isn’t it?
Well, hello!\nWe meet again!\rCynthia has gone back to Sinnoh.\fShe is the Sinnoh League Champion.\rShe studies various ruins despite her\ntight schedule.\rHow wonderful she is!
You seem so out of place, not even\nknowing why you are here.\rDo you want my ABRA to use a\nspecial power to take you home? {YESNO 0}
OK. OK.\nPicture your house in your mind...\r
OK... OK...\nThe best of luck to you!
ABRA: Aabra...
