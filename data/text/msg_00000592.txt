Welcome to the Goldenrod\nDepartment Store.
The department store has a\ndecent selection.\rBut some items are only available\nas Game Corner prizes.
What kind of business would a\nTeam Rocket member have here?\rWe aren’t selling sanity here.
I’m raring to shop again today!
Be it Team Rocket, “Team Pocket,” or\nwhatever...leave me alone!\rI’m busy shopping and have no time\nto waste!
Mom’s good at bargain hunting.\rShe always buys stuff at lower prices.
Mom told me to stay away from\npeople in black suits.
