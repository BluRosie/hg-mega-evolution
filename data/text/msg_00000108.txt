The Battle Hall Multi Battle challenge\nrequires both partners to enter the\fsame kind of Pokémon.\rPlease confer with your friend and\nchoose the same kind of Pokémon.\r
CHALLENGE
Do you eat your favorite dish first or\nleave it for later?\rAt the Battle Hall, it’s better to start\nwith the types that your Pokémon\fdo not like. Why?\rBecause the opposition goes up in\nlevel as you progress!
That opulent stage!\rYour streaks of winnings are kept per\neach kind of Pokémon.\fEvery Pokémon can get up there.\rDon’t you think it’s wonderful\nyou can aim for the top with\fany Pokémon?
Slow...\rMy SLOWBRO is a cutie, but he’s even\nbattled the Brain here.\rThe Brain will take your Pokémon on at\nthe same level, to be fair.
SLOWBRO: ...Slow?
Here is a tip!\rYou should try the Battle Hall with\nnot just your favorite Pokémon,\rbut different kinds of Pokémon\nif you want to build your\foverall record as well.
At the Battle Hall, if it’s the same kind\nof Pokémon, you can enter different\fones and still keep your record.\rYou may want to have different ones\nknowing different types of moves.
You know how HOPPIP has two types--\nGrass and Flying?\rThat means it can appear as a\nGrass type and as a Flying type.\rMe?\rYou could think of me as...\na “Lighthearted” type and\fa “Beautiful” type, I guess.
A piece of advice...\rAt the Battle Hall, the opposing\nPokémon are matched in level to yours.\rThat way, you can choose any of your\nPokémon without worrying about\ftheir levels.
The Battle Hall lets you keep the\nwinning-streak records.\fThat’s neat, huh?\r...Wait a sec!\rMy friend and I can start challenges\nwith identical conditions and see who\fcan stretch their win streak\fthe longest.\fThat’s even more fun!
I keep track of the total number of\nwins from your longest Single Battle\fwin streaks at the Battle Hall.\rTo explain, I add only the longest win\nstreaks of each kind of Pokémon.
When your total win-streak record hits\ncertain figures, you will earn BP as\fa reward.\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, your total win-streak\nrecord is presently {STRVAR_1 55, 1, 0}.\r
Your total win-streak record has\nreached {STRVAR_1 55, 2, 0}.\fHere is your BP reward.\r
When your total win-streak record\nreaches {STRVAR_1 55, 3, 0}, you will earn BP.
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received {STRVAR_1 53, 4, 0} BP!
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, your total win-streak\nrecord stands at {STRVAR_1 55, 1, 0}.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, your total win-streak\nrecord stands at {STRVAR_1 55, 1, 0}.\r...My goodness!\nThat’s a fantastic record!
Winston: The Battle Hall’s been kind of\nboring lately.\rThere haven’t been any dazzling\nchallengers who can electrify crowds.\rThe kind of challenger who can beat the\nBrain... Aren’t there any around?
Winston: Let me take a wild guess.\nAre you getting into the Battle Hall?\fIt’s addictively fun, huh?\rThe more you win, the more kinds of\nPokémon you get to see, too.
Winston: ...\n...Oh, sorry for staring!\rI saw you on stage the last time.\nYou’ve got some star quality.\rI think I’m going to keep an eye on you.\nThere’s real charisma there.
Winston: I check you out every time\nyou get up on stage.\rYou’re fun to watch, let me tell you.\rNow I’m always looking forward to\nseeing the combo of you and your\fPokémon on stage.
Winston: Hey, there!\nWhat are you going to do this time?\rWhich Pokémon are you going for a\nrecord with next?\rWhen I get to thinking about that,\nI get too wound up to sleep at night.\rThat’s why I’ve been sleeping in lately!
Winston: Awesome!\nSeriously awesome!\fYou’re beyond awesome, even!\rThe love you show so many Pokémon...\nIt’s no easy feat, I can tell ya!
Winston: I’ve never seen Pokémon\nbattle as enjoyably as yours do.\rYou’re the first of a kind for me as\nTrainers go.\rYou know, I brag about you to everyone\nwho’s willing to listen.\rI was saying that you’re going to be a\nstar before you even got a record!
Winston: Go, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, go!\nGo, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, go!\rI’m thinking up some dance steps and\ncheers I can do to support you.\rIf you want to see them, you’ll need to\nkeep working on your records!
Winston: You’re phenomenal.\nAll the battles you waged on stage...\fAll those moments of glory...\rYour star burns so bright and huge!\nI can barely open my eyes around you!
Winston: The love for Pokémon you\nexhibited at the Battle Hall is as\finfinitely deep as it is wide...\rYou can count on me, Winston, to be\nyour lifelong fan.\rJust as you love Pokémon, I love you\nas the Pokémon superstar!
Serena: It’s about the Battle Hall...\nIt hasn’t excited me lately.\rThere’s been no gorgeous sort of\nchallenger who can dazzle me.\rThe kind of challenger who can make me\na fan... Aren’t there any around?
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\rIf you don’t mind me asking, are you\ngetting into the Battle Hall?\rIt’s fun in an engrossing way, isn’t it?\nDid you know?\rThe more you win, the more kinds of\nPokémon appear.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\rI watched you when you were on stage.\nIt made me feel all tingly seeing you.\rUm... You won’t mind if I cheer for you\nfrom now on, will you? Please, may I?
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\rI cheer for you the best I can.\rI can’t get up on stage with you, but\nI want to lend my support to your\fPokémon and you for trying so hard.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\rCan you tell me what kind of Pokémon\nyou’re going for a record with next?\rWhen I start thinking about that, I get\nsort of all choked up.\rI have trouble sleeping at night when\nI get that way.
Serena: Um... Excuse me?\rFantastic! It’s fantastic!\nYou’re fabulously fantastic!\rThe love you show so many Pokémon...\nIt must take extraordinary effort.
Serena: I’ve never seen Pokémon\nbattle as enjoyably as yours do.\rYou’re the first Trainer ever who’s\ndone that.\rI... I brag about you to all my friends.\nI hope you don’t mind.\rI tell them I wish I could be as\nwonderful a Trainer as you!
Serena: Hurray, hurray, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\nGo, Pokémon, go!\r...Oh! Um... Excuse me.\rI was working on cheers and a dance\nroutine for you.\rB-but, I’m sorry for being so silly and\ngiddy and...
Serena: You’re so inspiring to me.\rAll the glory you earned while battling\nso often on that shining stage...\rJust seeing you makes me feel all\nhappy inside. ♫
Serena: Your Pokémon love that you’ve\nshown at the Battle Hall is as infinitely\fdeep as it is wide...\rIt’s amazing, but you love every kind of\nPokémon there is.\rI love you for being so amazing and\ndedicated!
Lyra: Hi, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.\nI love watching you battle here.\rCause...\nyou have fun whether you win\for lose!
Ethan: The Battle Hall is great for\nPokémon fans like me!\rI get to see so many new kinds of\nPokémon I’ve never seen.\rIt’s so cool!
Mom: {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\rI couldn’t help checking up on you!\rEveryone is working hard, but I have\nto say you look more delighted than\fanyone else!\rOh, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, that’s right!\rI should go to the Department Store\nin Goldenrod and buy some useful\fitems for you on the way home!
Professor Oak: You keep amazing me\nover and over again.\rWhat a Trainer you turned out to be!\rIt’s not enough that you caught\nPokémon in numbers beyond belief.\rThat alone is fantastic enough.\nBut you’ve bonded and battled with\fthem as well.\rI am so proud to know you!
Whitney: I love showy events like\nthe Battle Hall.\rI’m not saying that I want to stand out\nin the crowd...\rI just love seeing cute Pokémon\ngetting lots of attention!
