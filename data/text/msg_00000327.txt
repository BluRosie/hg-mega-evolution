Oh my!\nI remember there was nothing built here\fwhen I climbed the mountain.\rThings change, and it’s getting more\nand more convenient.\n
Many Trainers are visiting the mountain.\nYou never know what wild Pokémon you’ll\fencounter. It is very important to\frecover your Pokémon at a place like\fthis. Don’t forget to make a record\fof your progress, either!\n
