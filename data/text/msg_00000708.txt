Sheesh, the way you attacked! That was\nsomething else! We should meet again!\rHow about giving me your number?{YESNO 0}
I’ll call you when I feel like battling!
No? That’s fine.\nA definite no is easy to take!\rI’ll be right here when you’re ready for\na rematch.
So you want to register my phone\nnumber for a rematch, huh?{YESNO 0}
Well, you are special, all right.\rIf only I’d begun training Pokémon when\nI was a tad younger...\rI want you to work hard and succeed\nfor both of us.\fSo, take this, OK?\r
Uh-huh?\nIs that a river I hear in the\fbackground? You’re nearby!
Nothing can match my {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} now.\rYeah, we KO’d a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}!\rThat was OK, but what I wanted was\nto catch it...\rOK, give me a call again!
Nothing can match my {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} now.\rAnd, yesterday, we spotted a wild\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}.\rWe were debating whether to catch\nit or just gain experience battling it.\rThen, along came another guy,\nwho caught it! How about that!\rOK, give me a call again!
You’re thinking you’d like to battle me.\nAm I right or what?\rYep! We’ll meet on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!
Haven’t you gone as far as\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}?\rWaiting here is no problem,\nbut I’d sure like to battle!
You’ll battle with me again, right?
