To the north of Lavender is\nthe Rock Tunnel.\rGo through it to get to the\nPower Plant.
There’s a radio show that plays\nPoké Flute music.\rOh? Ah, your radio needs an EXPN Card\nto tune in to it.
If the Power Plant isn’t running, the\nMagnet Train won’t run either...\rIt also means the Radio Station\ncan’t broadcast...
The Director of the Radio Station\nsure was happy.\rHe said they’re back on the air,\nbecause the Power Plant is running\fsmoothly again.
