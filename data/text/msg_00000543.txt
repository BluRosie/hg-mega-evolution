Professor Elm: Oh, hey! I got an email!\r
Professor Elm: ...\nHm... Uh-huh... OK...\r
Professor Elm: Hey, listen.\nI have this acquaintance that people\fcall Mr. Pokémon.\rHe keeps finding weird things and\nraving about his discoveries.\rAnyway, I just got an email from him\nsaying that this time it’s real.\rIt’s probably another Pokémon Egg,\nbut we’re still so busy with our\fPokémon research...\rWait!\nI know!\rYou can go in our place, right?\nCan we count on you?\rYou can choose one of the Pokémon\nover there.\r
Professor Elm: If a wild Pokémon\nappears, let your Pokémon battle it!
Professor Elm: Where are you going?\nThe Poké Balls are in that device.\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0}\nfrom Professor Elm!

Is {STRVAR_1 1, 1, 0} the nickname\nyou want to give? {YESNO 0}
Professor Elm: How do you like walking\nwith your Pokémon? It’s not bad, is it?\rYou can take it all the way to\nMr. Pokémon’s house.\rIf your Pokémon gets hurt...\r
You should heal it with this machine.\rIt’s so easy to use.\nJust check the PC on my desk!\r
Professor Elm: Mr. Pokémon goes\neverywhere and finds rarities.\fHis house is past Cherrygrove City.\rGo north a little past Cherrygrove.\fI’m counting on you, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!

There are two valuable Pokémon left!\n...But they belong to Professor Elm.
There is one valuable Pokémon left!\nYou didn’t notice before, but it is\fbehind thick glass walls now so\fnothing bad can happen to it!
There are no valuable Pokémon left...\rYou wonder who Professor Elm gave the\nlast Pokémon to?
Huh? Me?\nI’m not the professor.\rHe’s at the back of the room.\n

Lyra: Hold on a second!\nHe has nothing to do with it!\rI saw it.\nThere was a red-haired boy\flooking into the building!\r
Ethan: Hold on a second!\nShe has nothing to do with it!\rI saw it.\nThere was a red-haired boy\flooking into the building!\r

{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} handed the Mystery Egg\nto Professor Elm.
Professor Elm: Huh?\nThis is an...Egg, isn’t it?\rThis Egg may be something I’ve never\nseen...still it’s just an Egg.\rMr. Pokémon is always fascinated\nby Eggs.\rWell, since he gave it to us, we might\nas well find out what secret it holds.\rI’ll keep it for a while to find out\nabout the Egg.\r
Professor Elm: What?!\rProfessor Oak gave you a Pokédex?\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, is that true?

Professor Elm: Don’t give up! I’ll call\nif I learn anything about that Egg!
There was a loud noise outside...\nWhen we went to look, someone\fstole a Pokémon.\rSigh... \nThat stolen Pokémon.\rI wonder how it’s doing.\nThey say a Pokémon raised by a bad\fperson turns bad itself.
Professor Elm: {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}?\nDidn’t you meet my assistant?\rHe should have met you with the Egg\nat Violet City’s Poké Mart.

It made me cry!\r
The one who took it...\nI mean the red-haired boy\fcame up with the Pokémon.\rBut I saw his face as he passed\nme here. He looked so happy!

Good job!\rThat Egg that appeared to be rare has\nbrought you so much trouble, I guess.\rThe Kimono Girls said something\nabout me?\fI don’t have anything to do with it.\rYou made up your mind yourself\nand went through with your decision.\rHaving achieved such a thing,\nyou should be able to take on\fthe Pokémon League now!\rYou should head for the\nIndigo Plateau!\rDo you know how to get there?\nFollow Route 27 to reach Route 26.\fOnce you get there, go straight north!

Professor Elm: That is quite a\nrare PICHU!\fCan I take a look at it closely?\r
Hmm...\nOne of the ears is spiky...\fThat’s strange.\fThere seems to be something more to it.\rIt really is a rare sight.\r
You met it at the Ilex Forest?\rA mysterious Pokémon called CELEBI\nhas been sighted there, or so I heard.\r
Speaking of that...\r
Professor Oak once wrote about\nCELEBI and {COLOR 1}Time Travel{COLOR 0} in a research\fpaper he presented at a conference!\r
Professor Elm: CELEBI can use its\nmystic power called {COLOR 1}Time Travel{COLOR 0}...to\ftravel to the past and future.\r
If this PICHU has traveled through\ntime, perhaps you should take\fextra care of it, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.\rIt seems that this PICHU has been\naffected by traveling so far through\ftime with CELEBI.\rI’ll inform the Pokémon Center of it.\rThe lady at the reception should be\nable to tell you if anything may affect\fthat PICHU.

Something’s funny...\nI would expect it to evolve into\fPIKACHU since it likes its Trainer\fthis much...\r
Let me see...\rHmm...\rCould it be...\rJust as I thought!\r
It seems that this PICHU will never\nevolve. It’s so strange!\rIts structure and the traveling\nthrough time must have affected\fits DNA.\rI’ve never heard of a Pokémon that\ndoesn’t evolve when it’s\fsupposed to...!
