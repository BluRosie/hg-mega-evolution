So many people have gone up\nthe tower with a Rainbow Wing\fto try and bring back HO-OH.\rBut none succeeded in making\nHO-OH appear...\rThe Rainbow Wing is merely to permit you\nto go up this tower.\rWhat HO-OH has longed for is the\ninvisible trust between people and\fPokémon...\rOr the person who can restore such\na relationship...\r
A long time ago, there used to be a\nPokémon at the top of this tower,\fnamely HO-OH.\rBut it flew away, and no one has seen it\nsince...\rIf anyone who could restore deep trust\nbetween people and Pokémon were to\fcome here with something linked to\fHO-OH... It may come down for such\fa person...\r
That thing you have...!\r
You have done it...\nPlease come through.
That Rainbow Wing will merely permit you\nto go up the tower.\rIf you are not the kind of person who\nwould restore the trust between people\fand Pokémon, HO-OH will never show\fitself to you...
Hmmm.\rSo it was you and the Bell!
You are quite a remarkable Trainer\nfor your age...
Morty: Bell Tower is where\npeople and Pokémon test their trust.\rYou may be born with some talent...\fCan we exchange numbers?\rI would love to examine the trust\nyou have with your Pokémon. {YESNO 0}
