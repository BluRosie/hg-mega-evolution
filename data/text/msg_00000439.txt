Oh? But you only have one\nPokémon with you.\rYou can’t go off without a Pokémon.\nCome back another time.
Do you want your Pokémon back? {YESNO 0}
If you leave me that Pokémon,\nwhat are you gonna battle with?\rCome back another time.
Huh? Now, now.\rIf you leave that Pokémon with\nme, you’ll be left with just one.\rYou will be better off if you catch\nsome more, if I do say so myself.
Now, now.\nThat is merely an Egg!
Fine, we’ll raise your {STRVAR_1 0, 0, 0}\nfor a while.\rCome back for it later.
