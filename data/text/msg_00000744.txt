You have to warm up before going into\nthe water.\rThat’s basic.\n
        
                         
Hey, you’re young and fit!\nDon’t ride your Pokémon! Swim!\n
      
                                 
Are you going to Cianwood?\rHow about a quick battle first?\n
        
                             
No inflatable tube for me.\nI’m hanging on to a sea Pokémon!\n
             
                               
You can’t see it from here, but there\nis a big city called Cianwood\facross the sea.
I took the ship to go to Olivine for\nsome sightseeing. I really liked\fthe atmosphere.\rBeing a port, it was nothing like\nthe big cities.
Do you know what lies just past\nthis gate?\rIt’s the Battle Frontier!\rEvery time I have a journey, I’ve\nraised mostly “useful” Pokémon.\rBut now that I am here, I think I\nshould have brought my\f“battle” Pokémon!
Hey!\nGreat waves here!\rNo one can resist such\ngood waves!\r
I see... You don’t have Surf yet...\nThis is just between you and me...\rI got Surf from a man at Ecruteak,\nand I think he’s still there.\rWhy don’t you try going there?\r
