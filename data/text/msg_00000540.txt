My daughter likes to mimic people.\nHer mimicry has earned her the\fnickname Copycat around here.
My daughter is unique...\rShe would make friends, then her mimicry\nwould scare them away...\fShe only has a few friends.
She recently lost the Poké Doll that\na boy gave her three years ago.\rEver since then, she’s gotten even\nbetter at mimicry...
