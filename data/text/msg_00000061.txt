Eusine: Did you see it?\rSUICUNE raced by like a blur, right in\nfront of my eyes!\rI have been chasing SUICUNE for almost\nten years, but I have never been this\fclose! I’m all choked up!\r
By the way...\nIt was clear to me that SUICUNE took\fnotice of your presence.\rEcruteak’s legendary Pokémon are said\nto come to people only when they\frecognize their talents.\rPerhaps I should be more aggressive\ntoward SUICUNE...\rAnyway, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, we will\nmeet again!\r
