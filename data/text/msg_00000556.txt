There have been reports of Ghost-type\nPokémon appearing in Sprout Tower.\rThey say Normal-type Pokémon moves\nhave no effect on them.

You cannot have your Pokémon out\nwalking with you in some places.\rPlaces like buildings, caves, and\nwhere there are huge crowds.\rBut all you have to do is to put it in\na Poké Ball!
