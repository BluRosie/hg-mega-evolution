We should trade phone numbers, so I\ncan educate you more on the\fmerits of Bug-type Pokémon!{YESNO 0}
You betcha. Thanks!\nI’ll call you sometime!
Don’t say such sad things...
Oh, did you decide to exchange\nphone numbers after all? {YESNO 0}
Oh, there you are!\rI thought I’d give you a Berry, so I’ve\nbeen waiting here for you!\rHere you go!\r
Wait, what?\rIf you’re nearby, don’t bother with the\nphone. Come talk in person!
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is growing up well,\nif I do say so myself!\rWhy, in a recent battle against\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}, it knocked it out before\fI could blink!\rBefore I could even blink! Amazing, eh?
Argh, I give up! My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} has\ngotten pretty strong, you know.\rI figured that it should be able to\neasily knock out a {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}...\rBut once we got a good look at it, we\nsaw it was really high level...\fWe got beaten up, down, and sideways...
You know, earlier by the roadside, this\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} jumped out at me!\rI really love Pokémon, but...bam!\nIt sure startled me!\rI mean, if you’re going to jump out at a\nperson, you should at least have the\fdecency to introduce yourself first!
You know, I’d really like to sit down and\ntalk with you about the virtues of\fBug-type Pokémon!\rWhat do you think? I’m on\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}. How about you come\fover for a battle?
Let’s have a battle. We haven’t had one\nin a while! I’m on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}...\fDon’t forget!
You know, my dad was a researcher\nstudying Bug-type Pokémon.\rEver since I was young, there’s\nalways been Bug-type Pokémon\fscattered all over the house.\rThat’s why I started to like Bug-type\nPokémon so much myself.\rMy mom...\nWell, she screamed a lot.
I found some Berries. I’ve already got\nmore than I need, so I’ll give you some!\rI’m on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}. Come pick\nthem up!
You want Berries, don’t you?\rI’ll give you some if you come visit me\non {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!
