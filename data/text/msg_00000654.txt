Hello? I can’t hear you very well...\nWe must have a bad connection...\rTry calling me again from a different\nlocation, please.
Hello... How are you?\nI’m doing well, thanks.\r
There are so many other Trainers out\nthere who are much stronger than me...\fYou should challenge them and see.
Let’s see...\nI’m usually free on Wednesdays\faround noon. I could spare some time...\rWhy don’t you call me again then...
Amphy’s gotten better lately. I’ve also\nbeen able to take some time to myself.\rWhat do you think? Would you like to\nbattle me again? {YESNO 0}
Got it...\nWell, I’ll see you in Saffron City at the\fFighting Dojo, OK?
I see...
Huh?\rBefore you battle me again, don’t you\nhave other appointments to keep?
Got it. I’ll be waiting at the Fighting\nDojo in Saffron City.\fI’ll see you there.
This is Jasmine.\nHow do I sound? Healthy?\r
You didn’t forget about your promise to\nmeet me for a battle, did you?\rI’m still waiting for you at the Fighting\nDojo in Saffron City...
Have you been to the Lighthouse lately?\rI’ve been so busy myself. I haven’t\nbeen able to get over there to see\fAmphy much...\rBut...whenever I see the Lighthouse’s\nlights at night, I always think,\f“I hope you’re doing well, Amphy.”
Um...\nThere’s something I’ve been meaning to\fask you... What did you think of my Gym?\fWas the atmosphere a little strange?\rBut...I mean, steel always looks\npretty cold and uninviting, but I was\ftrying to make it at least a little cute.
Warden Baoba at the Safari Zone...\nHe came over to my Gym once to\fintroduce himself...\rHe talks a little differently, doesn’t\nhe? I heard it’s called anastrophe...
