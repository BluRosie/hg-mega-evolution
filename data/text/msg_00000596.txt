Hello. Oh, your Pokémon...\r
It’s very attached to you.\rThis move should be perfect for a\npair like you.\r
                     
It’s adorable!\rYou should teach it good TM moves.
It looks a little bit evil.\nHow about this TM for it?\r
                     
There are sure to be TMs that are\njust perfect for your Pokémon.
Mystery Gift.\rWith just a little beep, you get a gift.
The Mystery Gift option is not\ncompatible with Game Boy Color.
I collect Pokémon.\nDo you have a DROWZEE?\rWant to trade it for my MACHOP? {YESNO 0}
Yay! I got myself a DROWZEE!\fThanks!
Huh? That’s not DROWZEE.\nWhat a letdown...
You don’t want to trade? Aww...
Hi, how’s my old MACHOP doing?
Huh? You...are part of Team Rocket?\nSince when?
On Sundays, a lady comes to check\nout Pokémon.\rShe even gives away TMs!
Team Rocket...\nWhy are they here?
You can’t rename a Pokémon you get in\na trade.\rThe name is a reflection of the original\nTrainer’s feelings for it.
You shouldn’t wear a black suit like\nthat. People will think you are a part\fof Team Rocket.\rWhat? You are one of them?
