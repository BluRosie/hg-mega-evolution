Welcome to Trainer House, the newest\nand most happening place in Viridian.\fWe’re open to Trainers only.\rYou can battle against the best\nof the best right downstairs.
Viridian is the town closest to\nIndigo Plateau.\rThey built this place because so\nmany Trainers pass through on their\fway up to Indigo Plateau.
They hold practice battles\ndownstairs here.\rI would love to see how well a\nTrainer from Johto battles.
You go all over the place and battle\nall kinds of Trainers.\rThis is not just to train your Pokémon.\nThis is also a chance to experience\fmany things yourself.\rI bet the Champion from\nPallet Town went to all the\fcities and towns in Kanto.
Whew...\rI’m taking a rest from\nPokémon battles.
