When you first see them
So many it’ll seem like a dream
There’s no reason for it, but
Only when you’re there
Whether you see them above or below,
If one walks with you as a companion
If you just try calling out its name
If you look at it from a different angle
It’ll resemble a teacher
You won’t be able to resist
Anytime
If you lightly poke it and see,
More than you expected
you won’t be able to stop laughing!
you’ll feel totally at ease.
you’ll feel so hopeful.
you won’t be able to look away.
you’ll be held captive!
you’ll be able to make a great friend!
you’ll be admired by all!
it will never cease to amaze you!
you’ll be intensely appealing.
you’ll think it’s so wonderful...
you’ll be so cool.
you’ll feel so strange...
you’ll think that’s one typical Pokémon.
Mary: This is breaking news!\nA bunch of {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0} have decided to\nmake an appearance at\n{STRVAR_1 4, 0, 0}! If you’re a Trainer\nwho’s really wanted to find {STRVAR_1 0, 1, 0},\nhurry over to {STRVAR_1 4, 0, 0}! That’s\nthe end of the breaking news!
