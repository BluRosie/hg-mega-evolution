Um...\nWho did you say I was again?\r...\n...\rOh, yes, I remember now!\nI’m the Move Deleter!\r
You’ve come to make me force your\nPokémon to forget some moves? {YESNO 0}
Which Pokémon should forget a move?\r
Remember me if there are moves that\nneed to be forgotten.
That Pokémon knows only one move,\nso it can’t be forgotten...\r
What? That’s an Egg.\nNo Egg should know any moves.\r
OK, then.\nWhich move should be forgotten?\r
Hm! The move {STRVAR_1 6, 0, 0}?\nShould that move be forgotten? {YESNO 0}
It worked perfectly!\rYour Pokémon has forgotten the move\n{STRVAR_1 6, 0, 0} completely.
Me?\nI’m the Pokémon Move Maniac.\rI know every move that Pokémon learn\nwhile they’re leveling up, and I can\fmake Pokémon remember those moves.\rI can make a Pokémon of yours remember\na move if you’d like.\rBut...ahem! It’ll cost you.\rI’ll make a Pokémon remember a move\nif you’ll trade me a Heart Scale.
Ha! That’s it! That’s an honest-to-\ngoodness Heart Scale!\rLet me guess, you want me to teach\none of your Pokémon a move?\r
If any of your Pokémon needs to learn a\nmove, come back with a Heart Scale.
Which Pokémon needs tutoring?\r
Which move should I make it remember?\r
Sorry...\rThere isn’t any move I can make\nthat Pokémon remember.
Hunh?\rDon’t you think it’d be tough for\nan Egg to remember a move?\rIt’s not even hatched.
                        
                 
                                 
                     
                                                                                           
                                  
                           
                      
                                                                               
{STRVAR_1 3, 3, 0} handed over one\nHeart Scale in exchange.
Hohoho...\nThey call me Grandma Wilma.\rI sense a slight talent as a\nDragon Tamer in you.\rWould you like me to teach a move\nto one of your Pokémon? {YESNO 0}
Ah, it is you again...\rWould you like me to teach the best\nDragon-type move I know to one of\fyour Pokémon? {YESNO 0}
Well, perhaps if you change your\nmind, do come back.
I see...\nI like your sense of adventure.\rHowever, none of the Pokémon with\nyou now can learn the move.
Fine, fine, now pick the Pokémon\nI should teach the move to.\r
Sorry to disappoint you...\rThat Pokémon you have can learn this\nmove, but it hasn’t come to trust\fyou fully yet...\rUntil then, I can’t make it learn\nthis move.
Sorry to disappoint you...\nThat Pokémon can’t learn this move.
Hmm...\rTeaching a move to an Egg is\na challenge that’s beyond me.
Oh? That Pokémon already\nknows {STRVAR_1 6, 0, 0}.
                            
                         
                                                                                        
                             
                         
                      
                                                                            
Draco Meteor’s destructive power\nis awe inspiring.\rHowever, using it will also lower\nthe user’s Special Attack.
Your quest for power has brought\nyou here...\rVery well.\rLet me reward your passion with some\nabsolutely astounding moves.\rThey’re the ultimate moves!\rShall I teach them to\nyour Pokémon? {YESNO 0}

Hmm... Well, that is fine, as well.\nVisit if you have a change of heart.
