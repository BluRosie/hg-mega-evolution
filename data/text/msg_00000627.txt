...You have strayed far...\nHere I have meditated. Inside me,\fa new power has been awakened.\rLet me share my power with your\nPokémon. Take this, child.\r
                     
Do you see it? It is Hidden Power!\rIt draws out the power of Pokémon\nfor attacking.\rRemember this: its type and power\ndepend on the Pokémon using it.
You have no room for it...
I am meditating...
