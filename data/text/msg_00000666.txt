Hello, this is Professor Oak!\rYou’re catching a lot of Pokémon,\naren’t you?

Hello, this is Professor Oak!\rIf you start to get tired, you should\ntake a break. Don’t push yourself\ftoo hard!
This is Professor Oak...\rWhen I’m recording my radio show, I\nhave to travel back and forth between\fKanto and Johto. It gets a bit tiring...\rOh, but never mind that! You’re doing a\ngreat job on filling your Pokédex!
Hello, this is Professor Oak!\rIt looks like you’ve found some Pokémon\nthat aren’t from the Johto or the\fKanto regions, haven’t you?\rYou’re a strong Trainer, and you’re\nreally making some discoveries!
...This is Professor Oak.\nI’ve been so busy with my research\fthat I haven’t gotten much\fsleep lately...\rOh, but never mind that!\nYou’ve made such good progress on your\fPokédex. I can’t wait to see it!
Hello, this is Professor Oak!\rHave you noticed that your circle of\nfriends has gotten bigger since you\fstarted working on the Pokédex?\fThat’s the best thing about Pokémon!
Hello, this is Professor Oak!\nYou know, I don’t see many wonderful\fTrainers such as yourself very\foften lately!\rI’ll have to thank Professor Elm for\nintroducing us!
Hello, this is Professor Oak!\nOh, you don’t have to say anything!\fI know better than anyone else how\fhard you’re working!\rI thought I should get you a present\nor something in appreciation...\fWell, I picked something up, but I\fcompletely forgot to give it to you!\fHa ha ha!\rOh, you don’t have to wonder about it\nat all. I know it’s something that will\fbe very helpful to you. You should just\fcome here and pick it up!\rI’ll be waiting for you at my Laboratory\nin Pallet Town!\n

Excellent!\nThat is an amazing National Pokédex!\rWow...\nYou’ve lived up to my expectations\fwonderfully!\rNo, you’ve exceeded them,\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}. You’ve become an\famazing Trainer!\rThank you, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!
Really, you’ve surprised me!\rBut just as I expected, you’ve\ncompleted the Johto Pokédex.\fI am so grateful!\rIf you’ve got that much determination,\nthen even more exciting adventures\fawait you in the world of Pokémon!
You have truly surprised me!\rYou’ve more than exceeded my\nexpectations. You’ve gone far past\fthem in completing the\fNational Pokédex!\rI’m speechless...!\rBecause of this, the world of Pokémon\nand Trainers is more vast, deeper,\fand more abundant!\rNow there will be no end to\nPokémon research!
Look for Pokémon in grassy areas!\r
Good. I see you understand how to use\nPoké Balls.\r
You’re getting good at this,\nbut you have a long way to go.\r
Hmm, you’re catching Pokémon at a\ndecent pace!\r
You’re trying--I can see that.\nYour Pokédex is coming together.\r
You’re training them well. You know\nsome Pokémon don’t evolve just by\fbattling with others, right?\r
Do you have a Fishing Rod?\nThere are some Pokémon that can only\fbe found by fishing!\r
Excellent! You seem to be good at\ncollecting things!\r
Some Pokémon only appear during\ncertain times of the day.\r
Your Pokédex is really filling up.\nKeep up the good work!\r
I’m impressed.\nYou’re evolving Pokémon, not just\fcatching them.\r
If you can learn how to use the custom\nPoké Balls made by Kurt effectively,\fyou’ll be able to catch Pokémon better!\r
When you trade Pokémon, you can also\ntrade information. Your friends can\freally help you!\r
Are you trading your Pokémon?\nIt’s tough to do this alone!\r
Wow! You’ve reached 200!\nYour Pokédex is looking great!\r
You’ve found so many Pokémon!\nYou’ve really helped my studies!\r
Magnificent! You have the ability to\nbecome a great Pokémon Professor\fsomeday!\r
Your Pokédex is amazing!\nYou’re ready to turn professional!\r
The goal may be far away, but don’t\ngive up yet! Keep going!\r
Don’t forget, some Pokémon only appear\nat certain times of the day!\r
If you break rocks, some Pokémon that\nwere hiding there might come\fjumping out!\r
That’s wonderful you’ve been able\nto gather this many Pokémon! The path\fahead is long. Keep up the great work!\r
If you Headbutt a tree, sometimes\na Pokémon might fall out!\r
A lot of Pokémon not found in the\nJohto region like to congregate at the\fSafari Zone.\r
Music on the radio might also entice\nPokémon to leap out!\r
Wow, you’ve gotten so far...!\nI’m actually a little surprised!\r
This is a critical moment!\nYou can’t become discouraged!\r
Just a little more!\nI’ve got high expectations for you!\r
I have never before in all my years\nseen such an incredible Trainer!\r
So, how’s your Pokédex coming\nalong? {YESNO 0}
