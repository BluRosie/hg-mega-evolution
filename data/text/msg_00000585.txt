If you treat your Pokémon nicely,\nthey will love you in return.\rOh? Let me see your Pokémon...\r
It looks really happy!\nIt must love you a lot.
I get the feeling that it really\ntrusts you.
It’s friendly toward you.\nIt looks sort of happy.
It’s quite cute.
You should treat it better.\nIt’s not used to you.
It doesn’t seem to like you at all.\nIt looks mean.
I keep losing in battles, and my\nPokémon end up fainting...\rMaybe that’s why my Pokémon don’t\nlike me much...
When I use an item on my Pokémon,\nit acts really glad!
