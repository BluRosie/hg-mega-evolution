Pryce: I am impressed by your prowess.\rWith your strong will, I know you\nwill overcome all life’s obstacles.\fYou are worthy of this Badge!\r
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} received\nthe Glacier Badge from Pryce!
Pryce: That Badge will raise the Special\nstats of Pokémon.\rIt also lets your Pokémon use\nWhirlpool to get across\freal whirlpools.\rAnd this... This is a gift from me!\r
Pryce: That TM contains Hail.\rIt summons a hailstorm that lasts for\nfive turns. The hailstorm damages\fall types except Ice.

Pryce: It is you...\rSince you are here, why don’t we\ntake a picture together? {YESNO 0}
