A Pokémon Center near a cave?\nThat’s mighty convenient.
The last time I came by the Power\nPlant, I heard somebody screaming,\f“Oh no, it must be a thief!”\rI think it was the Manager’s voice.
I hear Team Rocket got back together\nin Johto but fell apart right away.\rI didn’t know anything about that.
You can’t see it from here, but there’s\na Power Plant south of this\fPokémon Center!
