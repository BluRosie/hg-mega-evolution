Huh? I can’t hear you very well.\nWe must have a bad connection.\rTry calling again from somewhere else!
Hello...\nOh, hey, what’s wrong?\fYou don’t have to worry about me.\fHow are you doing?\r
Have you visited every Gym yet?\nThere are Gym Leaders you haven’t\fbattled yet, aren’t there?
I don’t do anything at all around noon\non Tuesdays. You should give me a call\fthen sometime if you’re free.
Woah, hey!\rYou called at just the right time!\nWanna battle me again?\fCome on, whadda ya say? {YESNO 0}
Woah, hey!\rThanks!\nI’ll be waiting for you at the Fighting\fDojo in Saffron City.
Woah, hey!\nThat’s cold!
Look, I appreciate that you want to\nbattle me again, but didn’t you already\fmake plans with somebody else?
Woah, hey!\nI’m waiting for you at the Fighting Dojo\fin Saffron City.\n
Hey, this is Blaine.\nWhat’s up?\r
We made plans to meet and battle at the\nFighting Dojo in Saffron City, right?\fI’m waiting for you!
You know, even if you lose your Gym, if\nyou take rocks and stones and pile\fthem up one by one every day, sooner\for later you’ll have built a really nice\freplacement Gym!\rI’ve made it my life’s mission to build\nanother Gym.
I am grateful that Trainers flock\nto a homemade Gym like mine...\rI thank you too for coming all the\nway just to battle me!
I kind of like the Seafoam Islands\na lot lately.\fThe problem with that is if you\fdecide to go shopping,\fthere aren’t any stores there...
