I’d love to do some more battle\npreparation and review with you...\rThat’s it!\nHow about exchanging phone numbers\fwith me? {YESNO 0}
All right, I’m looking forward to talking\nto you again. I’ll be sure to give you a\fcall if anything comes up!
Hey, you should listen when Teachers\nare talking to you!
Did you change your mind about\nexchanging phone numbers? {YESNO 0}
You know, I’m pretty sure I just\ncaught a glimpse of you...\rIf you’re nearby, you shouldn’t talk\nover the phone. You should talk\fto me in person.
Hey!\rYou got yet another zero on a test!\nYou don’t pay attention to anything\fI’m saying in class, do you?\fDo you honestly think you can beat a\fGym Leader with that kind of...\rHuh?\rYou’re not Travis...\rOh my goodness! I’m so sorry!
You know, I usually use {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}.\rDon’t you enjoy battling using your\nbest-loved Pokémon?\rBut it gets kind of lonely to just keep\nusing the same Pokémon over and over.\rSometimes I like to walk along with\nPokémon that I’ve just caught.\rThat can also be a lot of fun, you know?
The other day, I was battling\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} on Route 15. People\fstopped to watch, and soon there was\fthis huge crowd gathered!\fI got so nervous...\rYou know, I’m used to talking in front\nof a class of kids...\fbut Pokémon battles are something else.\rI just can’t get comfortable battling in\nfront of a crowd!
You know...\nThis is just between us, right?\rThe other day, I was trying to catch a\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}.\rI made a mistake and accidentally\nthrew out the wrong Poké Ball, and the\fPokémon got away.\rIt’s a good thing none of my students\nwere watching. But still, I was really\fembarrassed.
By the way, you’d like to prepare for\nPokémon battles and do some review,\fwouldn’t you?\rWe should have another Pokémon battle!\rI’m always on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}.\nI’ll be waiting for you there!
Hey! Do you remember you made plans\nwith me?\rWe said we were going to meet on\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0} and have a Pokémon\fbattle, right? Don’t forget!
That’s right... If you ask me which is\ncuter, my students or Pokémon,\fI’ll have a hard time making\fthat decision.\rCome to think of it, for a lot of kids,\ntheir first Pokémon is the cutest one in\fthe world in their young eyes.\rAnd there’s nothing that can be said to\nchange that opinion.
