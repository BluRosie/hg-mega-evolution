Hello, just when you least expect it!\nI am Cameron the Photographer.\rYou look so photogenic!\nWhy not have a picture taken? {YESNO 0}
All right, then!\nGet yourselves ready!\r
Good, good!\nWe’ve got a nice picture!\rYou can see all the pictures\non your PC.
Wait a second!\rMy superhuman ability is telling me\nthat your Photo Album\fis full!\rSorry to trouble you, but\ncan you delete some pictures\fbefore you talk to me again?
Hmmm...\nYou don’t seem to have a Photo Album.\rFor you to sort pictures taken,\nyou will need one.\rMy big brother runs a memorial photo\nstudio at Goldenrod City.\fWhy don’t you go there to get one?
Aren’t you a shy one?
There is an automatic camera.\rDo you want to take a picture? {YESNO 0}
It will proceed to take a picture.\r
It has taken a picture successfully.
The Photo Album is full.\rPlease delete some pictures before you\ncome back.
You don’t have a Photo Album.\rPlease go to Goldenrod City.\nThere is a tunnel there...\fAnd come back with a Photo Album.
