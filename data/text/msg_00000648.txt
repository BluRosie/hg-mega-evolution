Falkner
Who? You sound like you’re underwater.\nThis is not a good connection. At all.\rGet another line somewhere else, OK?
Hello...\nOK, now I can hear you.\fYeah, I’m in top form.\r
Are there any Gym Leaders you haven’t\nbattled yet?\fStep up! Get on it!
Let’s see... I’m free Saturday mornings\nusually.\fPlease, give me a call then.
I was hoping for an invitation!\nWe’re battling again, correct?{YESNO 0}
Excellent! Glad to hear it.\nI’m looking forward to this.\rI’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City!
Sure, sure...\nI know you’ve got a busy schedule...
I’ve got to say this...\nBefore we battle again, how about you\fkeep any promises you made to\fothers first?
I’m waiting at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City!\fThat was a promise!
Hey, this is Falkner.\nHow are you doing?\r
You know our plans to meet at the\nFighting Dojo in Saffron City?\fThat’s still on your mind, isn’t it?
My dad told me something when I was\na kid.\rHe said “Falkner, bird Pokémon don’t\njust fly with their wings, they soar\fthrough the sky because that’s what\fthey want to do with all their heart.”\rThat’s just like my dad.
The scaffolding in my Gym was in bad\nshape when you came to battle, eh?\rEvery year, we give the place a\nthorough scrubbing. It’s a challenge.\rBut the bird Pokémon help us out,\nso we’re able to manage.
You’ve chatted with Janine in\nFuchsia City, haven’t you?\rAll she ever talks about is her dad,\nyou know? Endlessly.\rI mean, it’s good to have a healthy\nrespect for your dad, but it’s\fbetter to have some self-confidence!\rDon’t you have faith in your\nown abilities?
