It was fun battling you!\nI’d love to trade phone numbers with\fyou, please?\fCome on, let’s trade numbers! {YESNO 0}
Thanks! Let’s have another battle\nagain sometime!\rJust give me a call when you’re ready.
Ulp!\rAre you saying you think I’m so weak,\nI don’t measure up as an opponent?
I’d do anything to get your phone\nnumber!\rPlease, let’s trade numbers! {YESNO 0}
Oh yeah.\nThis is a Shiny Stone.\rIt’s all right, don’t be shy! You can\nhave it. Go ahead!\r
Huh? There’s something odd about your\nvoice... Don’t tell me... You’re\fstanding nearby, aren’t you?\rIf you’ve already gotten this close,\nwhy not come talk in person?
I’m still a featherweight, as usual...\rMy constant companion, {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0},\nis training hard!\rIt even knocked out a {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} in\nunder two seconds in a recent battle!\rOK, OK, two seconds is a bit of an\nexaggeration... It was actually five\fminutes and 37 seconds...
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} has gotten pretty\nstrong!\rWell, it’s gotten strong, but this\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} it was battling ran away\fbefore the fight was over...\rThat was {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}’s fault, right?\rIt was my fault?\rI guess that’s a possibility!
Earlier, I was contemplating something\nwhile walking...\rSuddenly this {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} jumped out!\rI was pretty surprised, and then it\nran away!\rI was thinking about it, and I had made\nplans to trade with a friend, so I was\flooking for a {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}...\rIt’s too bad...
Where are you now? I’m always on\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0} myself.\rWhat do you think about battling with me\nagain? Sounds like a good idea?\fI’ll be waiting!
I’m waiting on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}.\nDon’t forget!
Ah... Ah... Achoo!\rAh... Ah... Ah... Achoo!\rOh, it’s nothing. It’s just that my bird\nPokémon suddenly started flapping its\fwings...so there’s dust and stuff from\ftheir wings floating around my face...\fAh... Ah... Now my nose is itchy...\rAchoooo!
My Pokémon was holding something in its\nmouth recently.\rI was thinking “What in the world?” and\nI pulled it out... It was a Shiny Stone!\fI was surprised. Wouldn’t you be?\r...But what’s a Shiny Stone?\rI don’t really have any use for it, and\nI don’t know what it’s worth...so I’ll\fjust give it to you!\rI’ll wait for you on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}.\nCome get it!
You want a Shiny Stone, right?\nI’m on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}. Come get it!
