Will you battle against the Hall Matron?
Excuse me!\nPlease hold on a moment.\rIn recognition of your remarkable\nwinning streak, our Frontier Brain is\fdemanding a match with you.\rActually, you have no choice.\nYou must battle our Hall Matron!\r
Argenta: My Battle Hall allows Trainers\nto mount challenges with their one\fpreferred Pokémon.\rI imagine there were tense moments\ngetting here with your chosen one.\rBut understand that one shines the\nbrightest when a challenge is overcome.\rI am Argenta, and I am your final and\nmost daunting challenge.\rI dare you to overcome my challenge.\r
Argenta: Well!\nMy goodness, your Pokémon...\fIt’s got star power beyond belief.\rEven from inside its Poké Ball, I can\nfeel its charismatic brilliance.\rBut I’m the Hall Matron.\nI’ll be the judge of that.\rI must battle it for myself and see if\nthat brilliance is genuine.\rThat is why we must battle now.\r
Argenta: A good Trainer doesn’t force\ntheir preferred Pokémon on anyone.\rA good one keeps with their favorite\nwithout drama or fanfare.\rThat is how I see it, at least.\rAnd, by the way I see it, you’re an\nexcellent Trainer!\rBe sure to visit the Battle Hall again\nwith a favorite Pokémon.\rUntil then, bye-bye!\r
Argenta: You must never forget there\nis a place where everyone can shine.\rThat goes for any and every kind of\nPokémon, too.\rSpread that message in your own words.\nIt’s one everyone should hear.\rAnd now, having lost, this lady has\nnothing left to say at all, but...\rBye-bye!\r
Please select what type of Pokémon\nyou’d like to battle.
