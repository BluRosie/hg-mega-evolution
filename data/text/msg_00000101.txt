Some Trainers rely on a Pokémon’s\npotential alone. But you can use items\fand medicines to help improve a\fPokémon’s capabilities.
Mountain climbing and Pokémon are\nsimilar in a sense.\rThey both come down to potential!\rI do not rely on items or medicines\nbut rather potential and training\ffor battle!
