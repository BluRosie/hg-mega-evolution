Deep inside far-off Indigo Plateau is\nthe Pokémon League.\rI hear the best Trainers gather there\nfrom around the country.
There was this move I just had\nto teach my Pokémon.\rSo I got the Move Deleter to make it\nforget an HM move.
They say that behind the Pokémon Gym is\na special cave for Gym Leaders to train\fthemselves.
