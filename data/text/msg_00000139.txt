My boyfriend’s a Pokéathlete.\rBut he’s so shy about it that I root\nfor him behind a column so he won’t\fspot me!
Don’t you think he’s so cool dripping\nsweat just like his Pokémon?\rNot that he even compares to the great\nPokéathlete {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}, though.
Participate in the Pokéathlon to\nreduce stress.\fThat’s the way to go!
Don’t you dare underestimate your mom.\nThe look on her face when she was\fselling things at a bargain...\rIt still gives me shivers!\r
