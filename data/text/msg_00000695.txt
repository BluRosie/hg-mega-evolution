Whenever I see a strong Trainer,\nI want to be their cheerleader.\rWhen I’m out on a walk,\nI sometimes pick up items.\rIf I find anything, you can have it!\rWant to give me your number?\nI’ll call whenever I get anything.{YESNO 0}
I’ll call as soon as I get anything!
Really? Well, I’ll still be cheering\nfor you!

You’re here at last!\nI think this will make you happy.\r
You must really like phone calls to be\nright nearby and using the phone!

I picked up something nice today.\nI want you to have it, so I called!\rYou will come for it, won’t you?\n{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0} is where I am.
