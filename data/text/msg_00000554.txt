When I was a wee lad, I was a\nhotshot Trainer!\rHere’s some words of advice: catch\na lot of Pokémon!\rBut you can only take six with you.\rIf you catch more, they’ll be sent to\nyour PC.\rThey won’t run away from the PC, so\nthere is no need to be alarmed.\rRemember what I’m about to tell you...\nTreat them all with utmost kindness!
