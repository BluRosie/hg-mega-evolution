This is my trusted pal, POLIWRATH.\rI wonder if it will become a Frog\nPokémon someday.
POLIWRATH: Poli poli!
Oh, my!\nWere you staring at me?\rSeeing me come out of the Game Corner\nwith a whole pile of Coins...\fAnd grinning to myself?\fYou were, weren’t you?
GRIMER started to appear recently.\nYou see the pond in front of the house?\rIt has GRIMER, too.\nI wonder where they came from.\rSigh...
Ha ha! This Gym is great!\nIt’s full of strong Trainers!
I’ll tell you a secret!\rThe Celadon Condominiums have some\nplaces you can only reach by taking the\felevator on the second floor!
The restaurant there is having an\neating contest.\rI heard that we have a great\ncontestant from the Sinnoh region\fthis year.
The Celadon Department Store offers\nthe widest range of items!\fYou can buy anything you want!\r...Do I sound like their\nsales representative?
I love this kind of place where\nthere are many buildings!\rI heard Johto also has a city called\nGoldenrod that has many\ftall buildings.\fI would love to visit there sometime.
Erika: Hi, Jasmine. I heard Whitney from\nGoldenrod Gym said you were too\fplain and should look more fancy.\fIs that true?\r
Jasmine: Yes...\rI’m thinking maybe I should\nparticipate in this Contest in Sinnoh\fto try and be more vibrant...\r
Erika: How did it go?\r
Jasmine: I couldn’t bring myself to\ngo to the Contest.\r
Erika: Oh, I see...\rThen why don’t you try putting on\nsomething especially gorgeous?\r
Jasmine: Ah, yes!\nMaybe I can bring myself to\fenter the Contest!\r
Erika: How about a fancy, light blue\noutfit with a cape over it?\r
Jasmine: What?\nThat’s too embarrassing!\r
Erika: I see.\nYou think Clair from Blackthorn is a\flittle embarrassing...\fI’m just taking notes.\r
Jasmine: Oh, no!\nErika, that’s not what I meant!
