Bravo!\rA promising youth who is about to start\nthe journey of archaeology has\fjust arrived!\r
What? Just a visitor?\nOh, I see...\fYou got me excited for nothing.
My staff here at the Ruins Research\nCenter is excellent, and the research\fmakes good progress with absolutely\fno effort on my part.\rIf you have any questions, feel free to\ntalk to my staff!
I managed to unravel quite a lot of the\nmystery of UNOWN with your help!\rThank you, thank you.\nThank you, again!
The ruins are about 1,500 years old.\nThat’s all we know about them.\rBut it’s not known why they were\nbuilt...or by whom.
Wow, did you catch an UNOWN?\nThat’s wonderful!\rCome to think of it... How come we’ve\nsuddenly started to see UNOWN?
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\rIt was you who solved the stone-panel\npuzzle that allowed UNOWN to appear.\rThose tablets are the key to waking\nup UNOWN!\rStill... Why would anyone make such\na key?\r
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\rIf you turn on the radio in the ruins,\nyou can receive mysterious radio waves!\rIt’s proof that UNOWN communicate\nwith each other using radio waves!\r
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\rThere are as many UNOWN as there are\nletters in the alphabet!\rThere have been 26 types confirmed.\nWhy don’t you collect them all?\r
How do you like the UNOWN Report\nI gave you?\rUNOWN are recorded as you catch them.\nIt is quite useful!
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\rWe have figured out that UNOWN are in a\ncertain order!\fLet me see your report.\r
There!\nI put the UNOWN in the correct order!\fWe may be able to tell more about them.\r
What?\nYou found a room with UNOWN symbols?\fThat is a big discovery!\rWe will study them right away.\r
You have to hear this!\nThis is a big discovery!\rWe have found two new UNOWN symbols!\rIt means that...\nThere must be two more kinds of UNOWN\fsomewhere...\r
You have to hear this!\nWe are learning more and more about the\fsymbols on the floor!\r...It seems that UNOWN were living at\nthe ruins with a human clan.\rIt is thought that this clan made the\nPokémon statues underground.\rThe UNOWN were easily scared and\nwouldn’t go outside.\rWhen more and more people started to\nappear around the ruins, the clan that\fwished to live in harmony with the UNOWN\feventually left...\rThanks to our research and your\nhelp, we have unraveled so much about\ftheir mystery!\rWe have so many things we don’t know\nleft, of course.\rArchaeology never ends.\r
I will let you know if I find out\nanything else.
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} opened the UNOWN Report\nand made notes!
Thanks to our research and your\nhelp, we have unraveled so much about\ftheir mystery!\rWe have so many things we don’t know\nleft, of course.\rArchaeology never ends.
There are odd patterns drawn on the\nwalls of the ruins.\rThey must be the keys for unraveling\nthe mystery of the ruins.
The strange Pokémon you saw in\nthe ruins?\rThey appear to be very much like the\ndrawings on the walls there.\rHmm...\rThat must mean there are many\ndifferent kinds of them...
Huh?\nI seem to be doing nothing?\rCome on!\nI may not look it, but I’m the one who\fdeveloped the UNOWN Report!
Ruins of Alph\nExploration Year 10
Mystery Pokémon\nName: UNOWN\fA total of 26 kinds found.
