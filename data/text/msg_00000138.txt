Welcome to the Museum Shop!\r
Wow, you have such good eyes! Can\nI tell you about my last dream? {YESNO 0}
Hmmm... My discerning eyes must have\nbecome weak...
I used to love Jump events.\rThe record I have from when I was fully\nactive as a Pokéathlete is 998 jumps!\rJust two more!\nAll I had to make was two more!\rI had to retire due to my age...\nCould I ask you to jump 1,000 times\ffor me?\r
Well, the record may make you dizzy.\nBut you’re still young.\fYou can do it!\rI’ll just sit and wait.
Oh! You!\nIt is so wonderful of you!\fYou have jumped 1,000 times.\rThank you so much!\nThis is just a token of my appreciation.\r
I’m now your fan. I’m old as you see,\nbut I will support you no matter what.
You know what?\nI have tackled over 500 times finally!\r
Haha!\nYou’re doing fine, but not as good\fas me. I wonder if any Pokéathlete\fcould be better at tackling than me.\fSigh...
You know what?\nI have tackled over 1,000 times!\fFinally!\r
You know what? I’ve finally tackled\nover 2,000 times! I bet no one can\fbreak this record easily!\r
......!\nNo! That’s not right!\fYour record beats mine?\rNooooo!\n...OK. You win.\rI admit complete defeat.\nPlease take this.\r
Whew!\nIt’s strange, but I feel great.\rI do regret that I lost, but it made\nme know where I am.\rI understand that there are many\nPokéathletes better than me.\rThis is where I begin to grow again!\nKeep up the good work!
