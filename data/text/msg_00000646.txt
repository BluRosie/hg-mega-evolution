Erika
Pardon? I can’t hear you very well...\nWe must have a bad connection.\rTry calling again from somewhere else!
Hello...\nOh, hiya, what’s up?\fThings are sweet over here!\r
There’s a lot of Gym Leaders who are\nway stronger than me.\fWe’ve both got to work harder!
My schedule’s fairly open on Sunday\nmornings.\rTry calling me then, OK?
I’ve got some free time right now.\nWould you like to meet for a\fbattle or something? {YESNO 0}
Yay, I’m happy! I’ve got another thing\nto look forward to now.\rI’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City.
Oh, I see...
Huh?\nWait, didn’t you already make enough\fother appointments before you called?
I’ll be waiting at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City. Please don’t forget!
This is Erika.\nHow are you?\r
I’m waiting at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City...\fYou haven’t forgotten, have you?
Do you like plants?\nPlants are such delicate things.\rThe amount of water,\nthe condition of the soil,\fthe temperature differences,\fthe changing weather...\fAll those little things we don’t think\fabout can have such a huge effect.
Do you like telling fortunes?\rMe...\nI don’t really like the kind where you\fpull off flower petals...\rOh, but it’s not that I dislike the\nfortune-teller in Lavender Town.
What do you do on your days off?\rI like to tend to the plants in my Gym,\ntransplanting them and dusting\foff the flowers and leaves with a brush.\fIt keeps me pretty busy...
