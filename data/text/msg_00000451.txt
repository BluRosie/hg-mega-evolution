Professor Oak: Those Badges are...\rWow! You have not only become the\nJohto Champion, but you’ve collected\fall the Kanto Badges! Well done!\rHmm... No wonder I sensed something\nin you when we met.\rTell you what, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.\rI’ll make arrangements so that you can\ngo to Mt. Silver.\rMt. Silver is a big mountain that is\nhome to many wild Pokémon.\rIt’s too dangerous for your average\nTrainer, so it’s off limits.\rBut we can make an exception in your\ncase, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.\rGo to the Pokémon League\nReception Gate.\rYou can reach Mt. Silver from there.

Professor Oak: Hmm? You’re not\ncollecting Kanto Gym Badges?\rThe Gym Leaders in Kanto are as tough\nas any you battled in Johto.\fI recommend that you challenge them.\r
Professor Oak: Ah, you’re collecting\nKanto Gym Badges.\rI imagine that it’s hard, but the\nexperience will surely help you.\rCome see me when you get them all.\nI’ll have a gift for you.\fKeep it up, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\r

Professor Oak: The legendary Pokémon\nthat appear in the Hoenn myth?\rYou must be talking about KYOGRE\nand GROUDON!\r
Professor Oak: The Embedded Tower is\nprobably the ruins that has something\fto do with the Hoenn myth.\fIf so, the other one must be around.\rKYOGRE and GROUDON are said to have\nshaped the seas and lands!\rWhere those two are, the other Pokémon\nis said to appear as well...\fAll this is quite possible!\r
Professor Oak: It’s not hard to imagine\nthat the Red Orb will make GROUDON\fappear at the Embedded Tower...\rHowever, according to Mr. Pokémon,\nGROUDON does not show itself to\fTrainers with golden hearts, but only\fto those with shining-silver spirits.\rIt may be difficult for you alone to\naccomplish this, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.\rBut if you manage to obtain a GROUDON\nthat came from the Embedded Tower,\rplease do come and show me both\nlegendary Pokémon!\rI will then share with you the rest of\nthe Hoenn myth!\r

Professor Oak: You did it,\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\fYou caught both KYOGRE and GROUDON!\fOK!\fI would like to entrust this to you!\r
Professor Oak: You did it,\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}!\fYou caught both KYOGRE and GROUDON!\fOK!\fI would like to entrust this to you!\r
Professor Oak: It resembles the Orb\nyou received from Mr. Pokémon,\fdoesn’t it?\rIt is called the Jade Orb.\nIt has something to do with RAYQUAZA.\rLegend has it that the battle\nbetween GROUDON and KYOGRE\fshaped the lands and seas of Hoenn.\rVolcanic eruptions and giant waves are\nsaid to have completely changed the\fshape of the land there.\rBut then RAYQUAZA came down to\nhalt the battle.\rIt is a Pokémon that rules the skies!\rIf the Embedded Tower is related to\nKYOGRE and GROUDON,\rthen going there with that Jade Orb\nwill surely make something happen.\r
Professor Oak: Go to the Embedded\nTower with the Jade Orb!\r
Professor Oak: You have successfully\ncaught RAYQUAZA!\rThe strong power of the Jade Orb\nmust have attracted RAYQUAZA there!\rPokémon are sometimes greatly\nattracted by certain Orbs and Stones.\fNo one knows why.\rPerhaps memories from ancient times...\fwhen this planet was born...\fand Pokémon, also...\fare making Pokémon behave that way.\r

Professor Oak: If a wild Pokémon\nappears, your Pokémon can battle it.\rWith it at your side, you should be able\nto reach the next town...\rWhat am I saying?\nYou already know all this!\fHahaha!
Professor Oak: There is nothing more\nthat I can do for you.\rEnjoy the rest of your journey\nwith that new Pokémon!
This is Professor Oak’s Pokémon.\n{STRVAR_1 3, 1, 0} will probably not\fsteal it like before...
Professor Oak: Good to see you!\nThis is what I’ve wanted to\fgive to you!\r
