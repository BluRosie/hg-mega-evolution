You’re really good with Pokémon!\rBoys give me items after battles, but\nsometimes they give me too much.\rNext time, I can share some if you\nwant. Let me get your\fphone number. {YESNO 0}
Next time a boy gives me something after\na battle, I’ll share with you!\rDoes that make me sound ungrateful?
Aww, you don’t want anything?\nBut it’s all for free...
I’ll share my gifts with you.\rLet me get your phone number.{YESNO 0}
Hi! Are you here for your gift?\rThis should really make your day!\r
Hey, tell me, don’t you think that the\nsight of a girl on the phone is charming?\rIt’s not?\rHa ha ha, you’re nearby, aren’t you?\nWhy not come over here and talk in\fperson?
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is getting prettier!\nI’ve been taking tons of pictures!\rIt took only a second to defeat a wild\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}.\r...Probably because you gave me some\nbattling tips last time!\rLater!
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is getting prettier!\nI’ve been taking tons of pictures!\rYou know what? A wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}\ngot away from me again.\rIt was so close!\nReally, just a little bit more, and I\fwould’ve...\rLater!
Right now, I’m on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}.\rIf you’re close by, let’s battle!\nI’ll be waiting for you!
Hi! You haven’t forgotten about your\npromise to battle me, have you?\rI’m waiting on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!
Oh! You wanted a gift, right?\nI got one, but I want to keep this.\rCan you wait a bit longer?
You know what? I got a good gift!\nAs I promised, it’s yours!\rI’m sure you’ll like it. Come and pick it\nup! I’m waiting on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!
