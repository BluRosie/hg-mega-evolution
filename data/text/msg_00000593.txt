The ladies at this department store\neven greet kids like me with respect.\rThat’s what I call professional!
The ladies at this department store\nnever change their attitude.\rBe it in front of a regular customer\nor a Team Rocket member.\rThat’s what I call professional!
The existence of this department store\ntells me that Goldenrod is a big city.\rThe selection here is unmatched\nanywhere else.
You better listen to me.\rQuit being a Team Rocket member\nalready!
I got my ABRA at the Game Corner.\fNow it’s my best partner.
Oh, Team Rocket!\nPlease don’t take my ABRA away!
