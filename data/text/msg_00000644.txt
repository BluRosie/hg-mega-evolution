Whitney
Um, ’scuse me? I can’t hear you very\nwell. We must have a bad connection.\rTry calling again from somewhere else!
Hello...\nUm, hey, what’s up?\fI’m doing great over here...totally!\r
There are so many Gym Leaders that are\nstronger than me... Um, I really need\fto work harder and improve!
I’m often bored Saturdays at noon.\nThere’s nothing to do...\fUm... So, call me Saturday, OK?
Yeah, I’m bored! Nothing to do!\nOh, yeah!\fYou wanna battle me again? {YESNO 0}
For sure! I really want to battle, too.\rUm, you know where to find me...\nthe Fighting Dojo in Saffron City.
What’s that?\nUm, bo-ring...
Um, really?\nYou really have time to battle me?\rDon’t break a promise you made to\nsomeone else--that’s not fair!
I’m waiting at the Fighting Dojo in\nSaffron City.\fBroken promises are unforgivable,\fget me?
Um, this is Whitney.\nHow are you?\r
Don’t forget you promised to meet me at\nthe Fighting Dojo in Saffron City.\fYou’re not gonna make me wait, are you?
Um, have you ever been to the\nMoomoo Farm off Route 39?\rMy Milky...\nUm, I mean, my MILTANK, is staying over\fthere now...
Um, I’ve gotta tell you, I’m so\nhungry... Do you know how it feels?\rI’m not an overeater or anything! This\nis completely normal for my age!
The coolest member of the Elite Four?\nUmm... I’d have to say...\fBruno?\rI’m not the only one. Everyone says the\nsame thing, seriously.\fHe looks like quite a guy...
