Urrggh...\nThe guy in the cape is incredibly\ftough...and I had no choice\fbut to tell him all the secrets about\fthis hideout...\rExcept that our leader’s office is\nprotected with two passwords!\n
{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}: ...\rSo you are messing with them again.\rHumph, you must really like Team Rocket\nso much.\r...Tell me, who was the guy in the cape\nwho used Dragon-type Pokémon?\rMy Pokémon were no match at all.\rI don’t care that I lost. I can beat\nhim by getting stronger Pokémon.\rIt’s what he said that bothers me...\nHe told me that I don’t love and\ftrust my Pokémon enough.\rI’m furious that I lost to a bleeding\nheart like him.\r...Humph! I don’t have the time for the\nlikes of you!\r
Muhahaha, we’ve been waiting for you.\nSo, you are {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}...\rMe?\nYou don’t know who I am?\rIt is me, Giovanni.\nThe majestic Giovanni himself!\fWahahaha!\r
...Huh?\nI don’t sound anything like Giovanni?\rI don’t even look like Giovanni?\nHow come? I’ve worked so hard\fto mimic him!\r
Petrel: I am a Team Rocket Executive!\rYou must be trying to sneak into the\nradio-transmitter room.\fWell, that’s not going to happen.\rThat room is protected with a special\npassword. The password is\f“Hail Giovanni.”\fSurprised to hear it from me?\rKnowing the password won’t help\nyou though.\rThe door won’t open unless I say the\npassword. It only reacts to my voice.\r
Petrel: Since disbanding Team Rocket\nthree years ago, our Giovanni has\fbeen missing.\rBut we’re certain he’s been waiting\nfor the right time for our revival...\rWahahaha!\rLosing to you won’t change the fact\nthat you are unable to get in the\fradio-transmitter room!\rYou need my voice to unlock it!\r
MURKROW: Hail Giovanni.\r
MURKROW is mimicking\nthe voice of Petrel!\rYou may be able to...!?\r
MURKROW: Hail Giovanni.\r
The door’s closed...\rIt needs two passwords\nto open it.
The door’s closed...\r{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0} entered the\ntwo passwords.\rThe door opened!\r
