Shall we trade phone numbers? {YESNO 0}
Call me anytime if you want to battle!
I figured that if I found anything in the\narea, I’d give it to you...
You wanna trade phone numbers\nafter all? {YESNO 0}
Oh, here you are!\rI’ll give you this Berry that my Pokémon\nfound. Here you go!\r
I have to say it’s kind of strange to be\ntalking on the phone when you’re\fstanding nearby.
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is always training!\rIt won’t lose to any {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}!
Hey! Psst! Listen!\nThis {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} I ran into earlier\fjust up and ran away!\rI was so disappointed!\nI really wanted to catch it, too!
Did you catch any {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0} yet?\nYou can always find them around here.
Will you battle my trained Pokémon?\rWe’re on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}, so give me\na shout when you’re in the area!
Where are you now?\nClose to {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}?\fDon’t tell me you forgot we were going\fto have a battle?
While I was walking around the forest\ntrying to find Pokémon, I cut my finger\fon a leaf!\rIt bled a little, but I’m fine.
My Pokémon found its\nmost cherished Berry!\rWe’re on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0} if you\nwant it!
Yeah... We’d really like to give you this\nBerry... We’re on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}, so\fcome get it please!
