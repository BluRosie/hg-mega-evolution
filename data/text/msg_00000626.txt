DRAGONITE: Gyafooha!
That red GYARADOS wasn’t acting right.\nAs I feared, somebody must have forced\fit to evolve...\r

Lance: Excellent!\rIt seems that the Lake of Rage’s\nMAGIKARP are being forced to evolve.\rA mysterious radio broadcast coming\nfrom Mahogany is probably the cause.\rAnd that suspicious souvenir shop...\rI’ll be waiting for you in Mahogany,\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}.

Lance: What do you think?\nAre you going to help me? {YESNO 0}
The GYARADOS are angry!\nIt’s a bad omen!
Hahah! The MAGIKARP are biting!
I heard this lake was made by rampaging\nGYARADOS.\rI wonder if there is any connection\nto their mass outbreak now?
Did my eyes deceive me? I saw a \nred GYARADOS in the Lake of Rage...\rBut I thought GYARADOS were\nusually blue?
Pryce: The strong rain falling on the\nsurface seems to be agitating the\fraging lake.\rThis must have some purpose that we\nmeet again.\rWhy don’t we exchange our phone\nnumbers? {YESNO 0}\n

Pryce: I make it a habit to train myself\non Monday mornings to give this lazy\fbody a spine.\rYou could be a good training partner.\nI’ll be waiting for your call!
Pryce: That’s OK, too.\nPeople ought to have their own ideas.\fThat’s the way it is.
Pryce: So? Will you exchange\nnumbers with me? {YESNO 0}
Battle with the great catch\nI just got!
                             
                                             
I can only land the same kind of\nPokémon. No matter how long I fish!
              
                       
When you spot a Trainer, it’s time for\na challenge!\fThat’s the way of Trainers!
                
                                        
What happened to the red GYARADOS?\rIt’s gone?\nI came all the way for it...\rOK, I challenge you!
