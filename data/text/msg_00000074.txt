Welcome to this chamber!\rWe are reconstructing ancient Pokémon\nstone panels.\rYou can rotate stone-panel pieces by\ntouching them for a short time.\rIf you touch a piece and slide it,\nyou can move it around.\rWe think we should be able to put them\nback to where they were...
You reconstructed the stone panel?\rThat’s great!\nWe have an archaeology genius here!
                                  
Nothing happened...
