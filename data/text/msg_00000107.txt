The staff tell you about the next\nTrainer you’ll face.\rThey’re very helpful here.\nDon’t you think?\n
They tell you about the next Trainer\nyou’ll face? That’s really nice.\rYou know, you can prepare for it\nonce you know what kind of Trainer\fthe next one is!
It’ll help you choose a Pokémon when\nyou remember what kind of Pokémon\fthe other Trainer had and what moves\fthey used.
This is a place to battle with rental\nPokémon, right?\rIt is a good chance to try Pokémon\nyou’ve never trained.\rYou’ll learn about new Pokémon\nwhile having exciting battles!\rWhat more could you want?
Do you have a lot of Pokémon?\rI’m not too proud to say this, but...\nI have only a few!\rBut there is nothing to worry about.\nDo you know why?\rThis facility, the Battle Factory, has\nyou use rental Pokémon for battles!
So you have to battle with Pokémon\nyou just met instead of with your\fcherished Pokémon you’ve always\fbattled with?\rOh, I don’t know if I could...\nWill they be nice to me...?\fI’m a little worried.
All the Trainers gathered at the\nBattle Frontier are nice,\fpleasant people!\rI’m patrolling here on duty, but\notherwise I would love to change\fmy uniform to participate!
