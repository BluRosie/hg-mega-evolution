A long time ago, this cool boy rode my\nBike around, and that started this\fentire Bike boom.\rThen I decided to open a branch at\nGoldenrod City.\rAnd they started selling like the wind!\rBut no one comes to this shop anymore\nbecause of that.\rAll I have left here is a bicycle pump...\rShould I start selling inflatable tubes?
