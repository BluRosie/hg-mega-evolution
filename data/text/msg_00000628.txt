The Lake of Rage is actually a crater\nmade by rampaging GYARADOS.\rThe crater filled up with rainwater,\nand the lake was formed.\rThat’s the story passed on from my\ngrandpa’s great-great-grandpa.\rIt used to be that you could catch\nlively MAGIKARP there, but...\rI don’t understand what’s happening.
The Lake of Rage hasn’t been normal\nsince those men wearing black arrived.
The Lake of Rage is back to normal.\nThe MAGIKARP have returned.\rI may yet achieve my dream of seeing\nthe world’s largest MAGIKARP.\rDo you have a Rod?\nPlease help me if you do.
Ah, you have a MAGIKARP!\nLet’s see how big that baby is.\r
{STRVAR_1 52, 0, 0}.{STRVAR_1 50, 1, 0} inches!\nA MAGIKARP of {STRVAR_1 52, 0, 0}.{STRVAR_1 50, 1, 0} inches!\rWow! This one is outstanding!\nI tip my hat to you!\rTake this as a memento!\r
The record is the important thing.\nThink of that as a bonus!
{STRVAR_1 52, 0, 0}.{STRVAR_1 50, 1, 0} inches!\rThat’s wonderful!\n...Or not.\fI’ve seen a MAGIKARP\fof the same size before.
This MAGIKARP is {STRVAR_1 52, 0, 0}.{STRVAR_1 50, 1, 0} inches.\rBut I’ve already seen a MAGIKARP that\nwas {STRVAR_1 52, 2, 0}.{STRVAR_1 50, 3, 0} inches.
What? That’s not a MAGIKARP!
...Your Bag is too full!\nNothing will fit...
Oh... So you didn’t get one good\nenough to show me?\fMaybe next time.
