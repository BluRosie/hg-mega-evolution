...Humph!\nAre you happy you won?\n

Say, you’ve got a lot of nerve,\ncoming here...\n
That’s ridiculous. There’s no way\nI could lose to a wimp like you!\n
...Humph!\nUseless Pokémon!\rListen, you. You won only because my\nPokémon were weak.\n
...Humph!\nI knew you were lying.\n

Out of desperation, weak people\nsometimes do OK at fighting back.\n
Don’t you get that I’m going easy\non you?\n
...Humph!\rI’m not fighting with another weakling\never again. It’s just too much playing\faround.\n

Hey, hey!\nWhy so serious?\n
No way...\n
...Why...\nWhy do I lose?\rI’ve assembled the toughest Pokémon.\nI didn’t ease up on the gas.\rSo why do I lose?\n
Humph. This is my real power, wimp.\rI’ll make Team Rocket history.\nAnd I’m going to grind that Lance\funder my heels.\n

I see. Seems it wasn’t just luck that’s\ngotten you this far.\n
Humph! You were too strong...\n
...I couldn’t win...\rI gave it everything I had...\rWhat you possess, and what I lack...\nI’m beginning to understand what\rthat Dragon Tamer said to me...\n
...Humph!\rI knew it. Strength is everything.\nNothing else matters.\n

I see. You weren’t coming to Kanto just\nto show off...\n
I see you weren’t playing around,\neither...\n
Humph!\nI guess it can’t be helped...\n
Hmm, seems my Pokémon are pretty good.\n

Why?!\nI’ve still got one left!\n
Do you think you’ve won already?\n
...\rOK. I lost...\n
...\rWhew...\nWith my partners,\fI’m going to be the Champion!\n
Why?!\nI’ve still got one left!\n

I hate to admit it, but you win.\n
All right!\nSUICUNE, were you watching us?\n
The wind is finally with us!\n
We can still fly!\n
I understand...\nI’ll bow out gracefully.\n
Even though it’s my last Pokémon,\nBug Pokémon are tough!\n
Hang in there! Just a little more!\n
Aw, that’s the end of it...\n
H-hey! Just one left?\nBut... I ain’t losin’, you hear?\n
Poor me!\n
Ugh...\n
No, it’s not over yet--not yet!\nI still believe we can do it!\n
We’ve got more discipline than\nanyone else!\n
How is this possible...\n
Properly tempered steel won’t be made\nrusty by things like this!\n
Steel will hang on to the very last!\n
Well done...\n
We haven’t lost yet!\n
No... Not...yet...\n
We...lost...\n
Humph... You are quite the Trainer.\n
Willow is my middle name.\nWillow is flexible and not easily broken.\fI’m not giving up yet.\n
Hmm. Seems as if my luck has run out.\n
One Pokémon left?\nThis is where the real battle begins!\n
You’re kidding, right?\nI’m supposed to win! I already decided!\n
I lost? ...\rI don’t believe it.\nThere must be some mistake...\n

Ho ho!\rYou some kind of big shot? We’ll see\fwhat happens if you get pushed around\nup here. Think you’ll stagger and fall?\rPeople here are training night and\nday to become bird Pokémon masters.\rBring it on!\r
Gaaah!\n
Falkner’s skills are for real!\rDon’t get cocky!
I can’t believe how ridiculously high\nthis is! But from up here, you can tell\fwhat it feels like to be a bird Pokémon!\rLet me see if you’re good enough to\nface Falkner!\r
This can’t be true!\n
Even though you’re a rookie Trainer,\nyou’re not bothered by these heights\fat all... You’re really something!\n
Amy: Hey, are you challenging the\nLeader? No way!\r
Amy: Oh, goodness!
Amy: You’re really strong!
Amy: You have only one Pokémon?\nThat’s kind of lonely...
Mimi: If you insist, we’ll be\nyour opponents.\r
Mimi: I’m feeling a bit dizzy...\n
Mimi: Our bug Pokémon lost! Oh, what\na shame.\n
Mimi: It’s a little unfair to battle\nsomeone who has only one Pokémon.\n
Bug Pokémon evolve young. So they get\nstronger that much faster.\r
Just evolving isn’t enough!\n
If you want to meet the Gym Leader, you\nhave to move the web using the switch.\n
You’ve come all this way, crossing the\nweb like a bug Pokémon!\rAllow me to teach you the charms of bug\nPokémon!\r
You proved how tough you are...\n
Just being in this Gym, I feel like I’ve\nturned into a bug Pokémon!\n
You saved all the SLOWPOKE?\nWhew, you’re mighty!\rBut my grown-up Pokémon are pretty\ntough, too!\r
Urrgggh!\n
If you move the web with the switch,\nyou’ll be able to figure out where\fthe lift is going.\n
You shouldn’t let your guard down just\n’cause I don’t look tough!\r
Gosh...\nI thought you were weak...\n
Who do you think are stronger--\nboys or girls?\n
I like cute Pokémon better than\nstrong Pokémon.\rBut I have strong and cute Pokémon!\r
Oh, no, no, no!\n
I’m training really hard to try to beat\nWhitney, but I’m starting to get\fdiscouraged...\rWhat to do...\nWell... If I lose, I’ll just try harder\fnext time!\n
Oh, you are a cute little Trainer!\nI like you, but I won’t hold back!\r
Let’s see...\nOops, it’s over?\n
Wow, you must be good to beat me!\nKeep it up!\n
Give it your best shot, or I’ll take\nyou down!\r
No!\nOh, MEOWTH, I’m so sorry!\n
I taught MEOWTH moves for taking\non any type...\n
I shall win!\r
I... I... I lost!\n
The one who most wants to win--will!\n
Not sure of your way?\nDefeat me if you want a hint!\r
Wh-what?\n
Having trouble finding your way around?\nThe path is right before our eyes!\n
I spent the spring with my Pokémon.\nThen summer, autumn, and winter...\rThen spring came again. We have\nlived together for a long time.\r
Wins and losses--I experienced both.\n
Where did Pokémon come from?\n
Can you inflict any damage on\nour Pokémon?\r
Ah! Well done!\n
We use only Ghost-type Pokémon.\rNo Normal-type attack can harm them!\n
My Pokémon and I are bound together by\nfriendship.\fOur bond will never be broken!\r
This isn’t real!\n
You seem to have a strong bond with\nyour Pokémon, too!\n
We martial artists fear nothing!\r
That’s shocking!\n
Fighting-type Pokémon are afraid of\nPsychic types...\n
Words are useless.\nLet your fists do the talking!\r
...\n
I lost! \nI’m speechless!\n
My raging fists will shatter your\nPokémon!\r
I got shattered!\n
My Pokémon lost...\nMy...my pride is shattered...\n
To get to Pryce, our Gym Leader,\nyou need to think before you skate.\r
I wouldn’t lose to you in skiing...\n
If you don’t skate with precision,\nyou won’t get far in this Gym.\n
Check out my parallel turn!\r
No!\nYou made me wipe out!\n
I shouldn’t have been bragging about my\nskiing...\n
Hey hey, are you shivering?\nAre you scared to fight me?\r
You’re so strong, it’s scary!\n
The strongest don’t usually look\nvery strong. I think you fit\fthat description.\n
This Gym has a slippery floor.\nIt’s fun, isn’t it?\rBut hey--we’re not playing games here!\r
Do you see how serious we are?\n
This Gym is great.\nI love snowboarding with my Pokémon!\n
I know Pryce’s secret.\r
OK. I’ll tell you Pryce’s secret.\n
The reason Pryce is strong...\rIt’s because every day he sits on top\nof very cold ice and trains his body\fand spirit!\n
Your first battle against dragons?\nI’ll show you how tough they are!\r
That’s too bad.\n
You’ve met the Dragon Tamer Lance?\nI don’t believe you.\n
It’s not as if we all use Dragon-type\nPokémon. It’s about more than that--\rWe’re interested in strong Pokémon.\nThat’s my theme!\r
Just what I expected.\n
I need to make my Pokémon stronger!\rPokémon and Trainers both need\nto train!\n
My chance of losing?\nNot even one percent!\r
That’s odd.\n
I know my shortcomings now.\nThanks for showing me!\n
I’ve been training hard with Clair.\nThere’s no way I can lose!\r
...Oh, that’s disappointing!\n
Oh...\nLooks like I need more training, huh?\n
Dragons are sacred Pokémon.\nThey are full of life energy.\rIf you’re not serious, you won’t\nbe able to beat them.\r
Way to go!\n
Dragons are weak against\nDragon-type moves.\n
We Psychics don’t give up even when\nwe’re down to the last Pokémon.\rThat’s what makes us so formidable!\n
Until we hit zero, our power is limitless.\nI’m not giving up yet!\n
I... I can’t...believe it...\n
One Pokémon left?\rHa ha ha! I’ve been counting on this\none from the very beginning!\n
Ooooof...\n
Ah!\nYou have proven your worth!\n
Fight as hard as you can ’til you faint!\n
We’re standing firm!\n
Why?!\n...How could we lose?\n
This is far from being backed into\na corner!\n
You’re no ordinary Trainer to have\ngotten this far.\n
Well, aren’t you good.\nI like that in a Trainer.\n
All right!\nI thought this would never happen!\n
I never give up, no matter what.\nYou must be the same?\n
...It’s over.\rBut it’s an odd feeling. I’m not angry\nthat I lost. In fact, I feel happy.\rHappy that I witnessed the rise\nof a great new Champion!\n

Heh heh heh... You’re unprepared\nfor this. We’ll knock you down!\n
Perhaps I’m the one who was\nunprepared?\n
This is the real power of Johto...\n
Ah ha ha! It itches! It itches!\n
Ow ow ow ow ow...\n
Looks like you’re the stronger one...\n
Hmm... You’re pretty good...\n
Looks like you’re not just someone who\ngets in the way...\n
Looks like this is it...\n
It’s not over yet. It’s just beginning!\n
Oh, last one! Never give up!\n
My electric trick...\n
Don’t go easy on me.\nGive me everything you’ve got!\n
Wow, that’s a bit harsh!\n
Looks like I underestimated you...\n
You’ve got a great battle technique!\n
Not good. Seriously not good.\n
...!!!\nSo... So strong!\n
What will happen after this?\nI already know.\n
Was the future I saw...wrong?\n
I get it...\n
I’ll show you the spirit of this\ncave Gym!\n
We can still do it!\n
My spirit has not been defeated!\n
Heh heh heh... You’re unprepared\nfor this. We’ll knock you down!\n
Perhaps I’m the one who was\nunprepared?\n
Just as I expected! No wonder you’ve\nbecome the Champion...\n
Ah ha ha! It itches! It itches!\n
Ow ow ow ow ow...\n
Looks like you’re the stronger one...\n
Hmm... You’re pretty good...\n
Looks like you’re not just someone who\ngets in the way...\n

I’ll show you the spirit of my\ncave Gym!\n
We can still do it!\n
My spirit has not been defeated!\n
Anyway, fight me and see!\r
I was deceived!\n
Me, I should be a pretty good practice\npartner...\fI shouldn’t say that about myself!\n
What do you think? You’ve never seen\nsuch a wonderful Gym before, have you?\r
Whatever!\n
There are many kinds of Gyms\nin the world, but I really like this one!\n
Looking around the room like that,\ndoesn’t it make you a little dizzy?\r
All of my Pokémon...\nAll dizzy and fainting...\n
Looks like you’ve still got some\nenergy left.\n
Ida: I’m Ida!\nNext to me is Elan!\fTogether, we’re a double team!\r
Ida: Wow. You’re really something.\n
Ida: If the only thing Gym Trainers\nhave is strength, they won’t do well.\rBringing out your opponent’s strength\nis also very important!\rElan: You’re stronger than we\nanticipated!\n
Ida: All right, let’s go!\rI bet that’s what you were thinking!\nBut you’ve only got one Pokémon.\rSo we can’t battle.\n
Elan: All right, let’s get this fight\nstarted! Come on!\r
Elan: Well, this is surprising.\n
Elan: Phew...\n
Elan: Huh?\nNot enough Pokémon?\n
The Trainers of this Gym use\nRock-type Pokémon.\rRock-type Pokémon have high Defense.\nBattles could end up going a long time.\rAre you ready for this?\r
I have to win these battles...\n
Hey, you! Trainer from Johto!\rBrock is tough. He’ll punish you if you\ndon’t take him seriously.\n
R-r-r-r-R-r-r-R-R-r-R-R-R-R--CRASH!\r
BOOM!\n
Phew... Broken in pieces.\n
Glub...\rI’m first! Come and get me!\r
This can’t be...\n
Misty says I have gotten much better\nin the past few years.\rBut there are still Trainers who are\nstronger than me.\n
I’ve been relaxing poolside, so I’ve got\nenough strength!\r
You can’t win with strength alone.\n
Hey, let’s go for a swim!\nSailors have to be able to swim!\n
Sorry about being away.\nLet’s get on with it!\r
I give up!\nYou’re the winner!\n
I’ll be swimming quietly.\n
Don’t get nervous watching my\nmagnificent swimming!\r
You’re not nervous at all.\nCool and confident...!\n
Swimming is very good for both\nbeauty and health!\rJust look at Misty, you’ll see.\n
Swimming isn’t just about speed!\nIt’s also about the beauty of grace!\r
I lost beautifully...\n
It seems an intruder has appeared in\nthis Gym...\fI don’t like that idea...\n
You’re here to defeat Lt. Surge?\nNot if I can help it!\r
Sorry I failed you, Lt. Surge, sir!\n
When I was in the military, this is what\nLt. Surge taught me...\rLock the doors, watch out for fire,\nand always have two electric fences\ffor safety!\n
Lt. Surge saw my potential with\nElectric-type Pokémon.\fThink you can beat me?\r
Ooh, how shocking!\n
The reason that Lt. Surge is protected\nby electric fences isn’t because\fhe’s a coward! It’s so you won’t\funderestimate his strength!\n
I’m going to take you down!\nPrepare to be shocked!\r
Gyaaah!\nI was overpowered!\n
Lt. Surge hid the electric fences’\nswitches at the bottom of something...\rThere are two switches. Once you’ve\nfound the first, the second switch\fshould be right next to it.\n
Jo: We protect Erika!\r
Jo & Zoe: We lost...
Jo: Wow, you’re about as strong as\nErika, huh!
Jo: I don’t know anyone who has only\none Pokémon!
Zoe: We’re going to protect Erika!\r
Jo & Zoe: We couldn’t win...\n
Zoe: How come you’re that strong?\n
Zoe: I don’t know anyone who has only\none Pokémon!\n
There’s no way I can let some unknown\nTrainer go straight to Erika!\r
Oh, bleah!\n
I’m too ashamed to face Erika!\n
Do you think a girls-only Gym is rare?\r
Ohh... I lost...\n
Thanks for not going easy on me!\n
How can I get you to understand my\nhobby? Which is...\ftalking in a deep voice!\r
Whoa!\n
The kindness of a woman\nand the strength of a man...\rI want to be a Trainer with both\nthose qualities!\n
My disguise was awesome!\nGrrr!\n
I had you fooled...\n
Ooh... I lost...\nYou’re not weak...\n
Oh, dear!\nI wanted to win!\n
Psychic power is the power of\nyour mind.\r
Your mind has more power than mine!\n
You made your mind stronger, not just\nyour abilities.\n
The Fighting Dojo next door was once\nthis city’s Gym.\r
I was no match...\n
Karate King, the master of the Fighting\nDojo, was just destroyed by Sabrina.\n
The power of all those you defeated\ncomes to me!\r
Strong...\nFar too strong...\n
What is the source of your power?\n
Fufufufu...\nI see it clearly.\rI can see into your spirit!\r
Though I read you,\nI still lost...\n
Oops! I forgot that I predicted I would\nlose to you.\n
You there!\nWant to battle?\r
Down and out...\n
You’re strong.\nYou obviously have trained hard.\n
If Trainers meet, the first thing to do\nis battle.\r
Awww... I’ve got a losing record...\n
For Trainers, it’s a given that we’ll\nbattle whenever we meet.\n
My bug Pokémon are tough.\nPrepare to lose!\r
I was whipped...\n
I’m going to look for stronger\nbug Pokémon.\n
My bug Pokémon have been waiting\nfor you!\r
If you walk in tall grass wearing\nshorts, do you get nicks and cuts?\r
Ouch, ouch, ouch!\n
They’ll really sting when you take\na bath.\n
Why do girls dislike bug Pokémon\nso much?\r
No good!\n
Bug Pokémon squish like soft, toy\nPokémon when you squeeze their bellies.\rI love how they feel!\n
Have you come to understand the merits\nof bug Pokémon?\r
Ah!\nThe weather’s as fine as ever.\r
It’s sunny, but in my heart,\nit’s rainy...\n
When it rains, it’s hard to get fired up.\nI just simmer...\n
Step right up and take a look!\r
Yow! That’s hot!\n
The greatest fire-breather in Kanto,\nthat’s me.\rBut not the best Trainer...\n
Hmmm...\nI don’t know what to do...\r
I knew I’d lose...\n
You looked strong.\nI was afraid to take you on...\n
I can run like the wind!\r
Blown away!\n
I wear shorts the whole year round.\nThat’s my fashion policy.\n
I’m raising my Pokémon.\nWant to battle with me?\r
Aw, I can’t believe I lost...\n
If you have a specific Pokémon that you\nwant to raise, put it out first, then\fswitch it right away.\rThat’s how to do it.\n
I have a feeling that I can win.\nLet’s see if I’m right!\r
Aww, you are too strong.\n
I heard CLEFAIRY appear at Mt. Moon.\nBut where could they be?\n
Um...\nI...\r
...\n
...\r...I’ll go train some more...\n
My PHANPY is the cutest in the world.\r
My PHANPY!\n
Take a look at this--this PHANPY’s\nabsolutely adorable behavior!\rIsn’t it wonderfully cute?\nI just wanna squeeze it!\n
My TEDDIURSA is the cutest in\nthe world.\r
My TEDDIURSA!\n
Take a look at this--this TEDDIURSA’s\nabsolutely adorable behavior!\rIsn’t it wonderfully cute?\nI just wanna squeeze it!\n
We’re the Kanto Pokémon Federation\nTrainer group.\fWe’ll drive you under our wheels!\r
S-sorry!\n
The Kanto Pokémon Federation will\nnever fall!\n
The cops shut down our Underground\nPath! That really annoys me!\r
F-forgive me!\n
Wiped out by some punk from Johto...\n
We’re the Kanto Pokémon Federation!\nRock on!\r
Yikes! Sorry!\n
We’ll try not to disturb anyone from\nnow on...\n
How does the Magnet Train work?\r
I wish I had the chance to see\nthe Magnet Train...\n
The power of magnets is awesome!\n
Hmm... You’ve got many Gym Badges.\r
Just as I thought...\nYou’re tough!\n
That’s to be expected for someone who\nhas as many Gym Badges as you do!\n
I came to explore Rock Tunnel.\r
Whoa! Danger, eh?\n
My Pokémon were hurt before even\nentering Rock Tunnel.\rI’d better take them to a Pokémon\nCenter right away.\n
Hey, you!\nDon’t litter!\r
I was just pointing out...\n
Sorry. You weren’t littering. It was\nmy mistake.\n
Mt. Silver is in Johto, right?\rIt must be a silver mountain!\r
I was kind of focused on the mountain\nand forgot my Pokémon...\n
Battles are about concentration.\n
I’ll tell you a secret.\nBut first, we battle!\r
Grr!\nI lost that...\n
The Power Plant is across a small river.\n
Have you ever been to a picnic?\nThey’re so much fun!\r
Ohhhh!\n
We bake lots of goodies and share them\naround. They’re delicious!\n
People shouldn’t leave any\nlitter behind.\r
Ohh... I lost...\n
Conserving energy is important, but the\nenvironment is even more vital.\n
You really love Pokémon, don’t you?\nI love Pokémon, too!\r
Looks like this means it’s my loss.\n
My dearest, very important Pokémon...\nI won’t forget what you did!\n
Hahahah!\r
Hahaha-hachoo!\n
Hay fever is making me sneeze!\nAhahah-CHOO!\n
...\r
...\n
...\rI lost while I had my eyes closed...\n
I can see it...\nEverything there is to see about you...\r
I couldn’t foresee your power...\n
Strength in conviction...\rYou’re strong because you believe in\nyour Pokémon.\n
There’s no cheating with Pokémon.\nLet’s keep it fair and square!\r
Huh? How did this happen?\n
I fought fair and square.\nI don’t regret this at all.\n
It itches and tickles a bit when I wear\nshorts in the grass.\r
Aiyaaah!\nI got stomped!\n
I’m going to catch more Pokémon in\nthe grass.\n
Do you remember?\r
You do remember?\n
The tug you feel on the fishing line when\nyou hook a Pokémon...\rThat’s the best feeling ever for an\nangler like me.\n
Ooooh! You did remember it!\r
Patience is the key to both fishing and\nPokémon.\r
Patience!\n
I’m too impatient for fishing...\n
I feel so content, fishing while listening\nto some tunes on my radio.\r
I was listening to my radio the whole\ntime... Is that why I lost?!\n
Have you checked out Kanto’s radio\nprograms? We get a good variety here.\n
What’s most important in our\neveryday lives?\r
The answer is coming up next!\n
I think electricity is the most\nimportant thing in our daily lives.\rIf it weren’t, people wouldn’t have\nmade such a fuss when the Power Plant\fwent out of commission.\n
Agility is the key attribute of\nbird Pokémon.\r
You beat me with your speed...\n
Your Pokémon are remarkably\nwell trained.\n
Check out my Pokémon. Just look at\ntheir coloring and plumage.\r
Shoot!\nNot good enough!\n
If you groom them, Pokémon get happy.\n
Ha ha ha ha!\fWould you like to fight my pack\nof PIKACHU?\r
My PIKACHU!\n
You look like you have many Pokémon,\nbut PIKACHU is still the best.\n
Bow down before my regal Pokémon!\r
How... How dare you mock royalty!\n
Doesn’t everyone wish to be\na ruler someday?\n
I should go to Rock Tunnel to get\nmyself an ONIX.\r
I lost...\n
Geological features don’t appear to\nchange.\rBut they actually do change, little\nby little.\n
Hey, I still wanted to battle you!\r
Let me tell you, I had a hard time\ncatching my prized Pokémon.\r
Awaaah!\n
SQUIRTLE, CHARMANDER, and\nBULBASAUR...\fI think that’s a well-balanced mix.\n
Sometimes I go back to the places\nI met my Pokémon.\fThey bring back good memories.\r
Where did I meet this PSYDUCK?\n
When and where did I get my Pokémon...\rI’ll bet if I checked my Trainer Memo,\nI’d remember!\n
My dream is to fly with my beloved\nbird Pokémon.\r
I can dream, but I can’t ever fly...\n
You have Pokémon that know the HM move\nFly, don’t you? I envy you.\n
Hang on. I have to phone my mom.\r
Sorry, Mom!\nI was beaten!\n
My mom worries so much about me, I have\nto phone her all the time.\n
We’re on a school trip to Lavender\nRadio Tower for social studies.\r
You’re wickedly tough!\n
I’m tired of walking. I need to take\na break.\n
Let’s battle.\nI won’t lose!\r
I forgot to do my homework!\n
Sayonara! I just learned that in my\nforeign-language class.\n
I love gym class the best!\r
Oh, no!\nHow could I lose?\n
If Pokémon were a subject at school,\nI’d be the best!\n
Welcome, welcome!\rHere you will face a battle with me, and\nI’m really athletic!\r
Have you forgotten anything?\r
Kyaaah!\n
Before I became a teacher, I used to\nforget a lot of things.\n
On sunny days, I think that the kids\nwould rather be playing in the\fplayground than studying in class.\r
I didn’t want to lose...\n
Studying is important, but exercise is\njust as vital.\n
You’re back.\rTo study?\nOr to battle Pokémon?\r
Hey, you!\nYou’re from Johto, huh?\r
Whoa, you’re kickin’!
Don’t get cocky, you Johto punk!\n
Hey! I’ve been waiting for you!\nYou Johto punk!\r
Wow. That’s a cool Bicycle!\r
But you don’t just look cool...\n
I look cool, but I’m weak, so I’m not\nreally cool. I have to train harder...\n
Hey! Want to have a speed battle?\r
Yikes! You’ve got awesome torque!\n
Hands-free riding is considered cool on\nCycling Road.\n
We’re fearless highway stars!\r
Arrrgh! Crash and burn!\n
Reckless riding causes accidents!\nTake it easy!\n
If you’re looking for Pokémon, you have\nto look in the tall grass.\r
Aiyeee!\n
Since you’re so strong, it must be fun\nto battle.\n
Cycling Road is a quick shortcut\nto Celadon.\r
...Whew!\n
If you don’t have a Bicycle, you’re not\nallowed to use the shortcut.\n
Have you ever gone swimming in the sea\nat night?\r
Glub...\n
At night, the sea looks black. It feels\nlike it will swallow you up.\n
Swimming?\nI’m lousy at it. I’m just splashing\faround in these shallow waters.\r
I thought I could win.\n
I might be bad at swimming, but I love\nthe sea.\n
Pant, pant... Just...a little...\nfarther...to...Fuchsia...\r
I’m drowning!\n
I...asked my girlfriend to swim to\nFuchsia... Gasp...\n
I’m disgusted by wimpy people!\r
I could beat you at swimming...\n
It’s a quick swim between Fuchsia and\nSeafoam Islands...\rSheesh, some big man my boyfriend is!\nWhat a wimp!\n
I guess it’s impossible to swim all the\nway to Johto.\r
Aiyah!\n
Besides the sea, I can also swim in\nponds and rivers.\n
I feel so much lighter in water.\r
Oh, no!\n
Swimming exercises your full body.\nIt’s really good for you.\n
What an impressive collection of Gym\nBadges. We should battle!\r
No!\n
Surf is no longer the only HM move you\nuse in water.\n
I’m bored by fishing. Let’s battle!\r
Utter failure...\n
I’ll just go back to fishing...\n
Gotta keep going!\r
Glug...\n
This arrogant guy was at\nCinnabar’s volcano.\n
Oh! Hey, you!\nWill you help me with my sunblock?\rDon’t tell me... You’d rather battle?\r
I’m worried about sunburn...\n
I have to watch out for blemishes\ncaused by the sun.\n
Ayieeeh! No, no, no, believe it I can’t!\nStrong very much be you! Match I am\fnot to you!\n
OK! I’m No. 4. I’ll stomp you!\r
Whoa! Too much.\n
We both did our best.\nI have no regrets!\n
But after seeing how you battle, I want\nto see how I’ll fare.\rHow about it? Let me take you on.\r
I’ve never had a battle this good!\n
That was a great battle!\rYou and your Pokémon are truly\noutstanding!\n
I’m No. 5!\nGetting tired?\r
I lost, too...\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
I’m the last in line, but I tell you,\nI’m tough!\r
You’re kidding!\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
I’m second.\nNow, it’s serious!\r
How could I lose?\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
Beat the six of us Trainers to win a\nfabulous prize!\rThink you’ve got what it takes?\r
Whoo! Good stuff.\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
Here’s No. 3!\nI won’t be easy.\r
Ow! Stomped flat!\n
I did my best.\nI have no regrets.\n
Mufufufu...\rI have nothing to do with the\nsix-pack Trainers.\rI waited here to beat you when you were\ntired out by all the battles.\r
Aren’t you tired at all?\n
I’m sorry... I won’t cheat anymore...\n
I’m making my final preparations for the\nPokémon League.\r
I blew it!\n
It’s going to be tough to win at the\nLeague. I need to do some more\rtraining. I hear that the League’s Elite\nFour are tougher than Gym Leaders.\n
By experiencing tough battles, you\ngain power.\r
Gah! Life is even tougher!\n
To get to the Pokémon League, you\nhave to get through Victory Road.\rBut Victory Road is tough.\nPractically nobody goes there!\n
I want to see how close you are to\nreal strength!\r
Since you’ve come this far, you must be\ngood. I’m going to give this battle\feverything I’ve got!\r
No! I don’t believe this!\n
I’ve defeated eight Gym Leaders, so I\nwas feeling confident.\rI’ll have to try harder next time.\n
I lost to a redheaded Trainer. He was\nreally strong, but...it was as if he\fabsolutely had to win at any cost.\fI felt sorry for his Pokémon.\r
Pokémon aren’t tools of war.\n
Pokémon are invaluable, lifelong\npartners.\n
You get along really well with your\nPokémon, don’t you?\fCan you show me once more?\r
Wow, look at all those Badges!\nI’m impressed.\rBut you’re not satisfied by just\ncollecting them, right?\r
Good battle!\n
People and Pokémon grow from\ntheir experiences.\rDon’t get lazy and complacent.\n
I’m feeling great today!\fI feel like I could even beat the\nLeague Champion!\r
No!\nNot in this battle!\n
Just like in fishing, it’s all over in\nPokémon if you give up.\n
Tweet! Tweet!\nTet-weet!\r
Tweet!\n
Bird Keepers like me mimic bird whistles\nto command Pokémon.\n
Tweet! I’ve been waiting for this!\nTeweet!\r
You look pretty strong.\nLet me battle you!\r
...!\n
If you prevail on this harsh trek, the\ntruth will be revealed!\rHeh, sorry, I just wanted to say\nsomething cool.\n
Hm? You’re good, aren’t you?\r
Just as I thought!\n
A good Trainer can recognize other\ngood Trainers.\n
You came from New Bark Town?\nYou must be exhausted.\r
Oh! You’re much too strong!\n
If you’re that energetic, you can\ndefinitely make it to the\fPokémon League!\n
You said you came from New Bark Town,\nright? I’ll watch and see how far\fyou’ll go!\r
It’s rare to see anyone come here.\nAre you training on your own?\r
Oh! You’re really strong!\n
I’m checking out pre- and\npost-evolution Pokémon. Evolution\freally does make Pokémon stronger.\rBut evolved forms also learn moves\nlater on.\n
Don’t say a thing! Let me guess what\nyou’re thinking. Mmmmmmm...\rI got it! You’re on the Pokémon\nLeague challenge!\r
You’re too much!\n
With your skills, you’ll do well at the\nPokémon League. That’s what my\fpremonition says.\n
I just lost, so I’m trying to find\nmore Pokémon.\rWait! You look weak! Come on,\nlet’s battle!\r
Oh...\nI’m out of Pokémon that can fight.\n
I knew it--if you don’t have many\nPokémon, battles are harder!\fI need to catch more Pokémon!\n
I’ve been waiting!\nLet’s battle now!\r
You’re a Pokémon Trainer, right?\nThen you have to battle!\r
That’s strange.\nI won before.\n
Becoming a good Trainer is really tough.\nI’m going to battle other people to\fget better.\n
Instead of a bug Pokémon, I found\na Trainer!\r
Argh! You’re too strong!\n
I ran out of Poké Balls while I was\ncatching Pokémon.\rI should’ve bought some more...\n
I caught a bunch of Pokémon.\nLet me battle with you!\r
Awwwww...\n
You can catch Pokémon even if you have\nsix with you.\rIf you catch one, it’ll go to your Box\nautomatically.\n
I was waiting for you. Let’s battle!\r
That Badge!\rIt’s from Violet City!\nYou beat Falkner?\r
I know what my weaknesses are.\n
I should train again at the Gym in\nViolet City.\n
That glance...\nIt’s intriguing.\r
Hmmm. This is disappointing.\n
If you don’t want to battle, just avoid\neye contact.\n
Whoa!\rYou made me lose that fish!\r
Sploosh!\n
Calm, collected...\rThe essence of fishing and Pokémon is\nthe same.\n
I’m really good at fishing, but I’m even\nbetter at Pokémon!\r
Tch! I tried to rush things...\n
Fishing is a lifelong passion.\nPokémon are lifelong friends!\n
Oh look, a kid challenger!\nThis old man ain’t losing today!\r
My Pokémon?\nFreshly caught!\r
Splash?\n
Freshly caught Pokémon are no match\nfor properly raised ones.\n
Uh-huh. Yeah, and you know...\rPardon? Pokémon battle?\nI’m on the phone.\rOh, all right.\nI’ll accept your challenge!\r
Pfft.\nBefore I could get serious, I lost!\n
At least I can complain over the phone.\n
You’re late! Let’s get started now!\r
I haven’t seen you around before.\nSo you think you’re pretty tough?\r
You’re strong!\n
I’m going to try to be the best with my\nprized Pokémon. I’m not using the\fsame tough Pokémon as everyone else.\n
I found some good Pokémon in the grass!\nI think they’ll do it for me!\r
Shucks. I thought I could win.\n
Each Pokémon has its own nature.\nThey seem different every time I catch\fone. So there must be many natures!\n
I came through the cave, but I still\nhave plenty of energy left.\r
Whoa! You’ve got more zip than me!\n
We Hikers are at our best in\nthe mountains.\n
All righty, then!\nMy Pokémon and I are raring to go!\r
I’m confident in my ability to raise\nPokémon. Want to see?\r
Didn’t I train enough?\n
Hmm... Maybe I should take them to\nPokémon Day Care? What should I do?\n
Hey, you’re back!\rBattle my carefully trained Pokémon!\r
I just got my Pokémon back from\nDay Care. Let’s see how much stronger\fit got!\r
Why does it end this way?\n
My Pokémon knew moves I didn’t know it\nhad. That confounded me to no end!\n
Kate: You sure were mean to my\nlittle sisters!\r
Kate: No! I can’t believe I lost.\n
Kate: You’re too strong. I didn’t stand\na chance.\rHere. You deserve this.\n
Irene: Eeek! A Trainer!\r
Irene: Ohhh! Too strong!\n
Irene: My sister Kate will get you\nfor this!\n
Jenn: You can’t beat Irene and go\nunpunished!\r
Jenn: So sorry, Irene! Sis!\n
Jenn: Don’t get cocky! My sister Kate\nis tough!\n
Are you a Trainer? Let’s have a\npractice battle.\r
Oh, no!\nI just can’t win...\n
You’re too strong to be a\npractice partner.\n
You’re here! You’re here! I’ve never\nhad a practice partner before!\r
What’s with you?\nWhat are you doing?\r
You don’t have to worry about the night\nwhen you’re with strong Pokémon.\n
The group stealing other people’s\nPokémon seems to be growing lately.\fYou should be careful, too.\n
This is where I do my training!\r
Whoa!\n
If you fail in practice, then you have\nto try harder! I’m aiming to be a\fGym Leader!\n
I’m the best in my class at Pokémon.\r
No! There are better Trainers...\n
I’m trying hard so I can be the star in\nmy class.\n
I’ve been waiting!\r
What kinds of Poké Balls do you use?\r
Yikes! Not fast enough!\n
Some Pokémon flee right away.\nTry catching them with Kurt’s Fast Ball.\rWhenever I find a Wht. Apricorn,\nI take it to Kurt. He turns it into a\fcustom Ball.\n
I’ve been getting Pokémon data off my\nradio. I think I’m good.\r
I give up!\n
Music on the radio changes the moods of\nwild Pokémon.\n
I’m gonna show my girlfriend I’m\nhot stuff!\r
I wish you would have lost for me...\n
I was humiliated in front of\nmy girlfriend...\n
I’m practicing my fire breathing.\r
Ow! I scorched the tip of my nose!\n
The Pokémon March on the radio lures\nwild Pokémon.\n
I’ve been practicing breathing fire\nwhile waiting for you!\r
Behold my dexterity and grace!\r
Whew! That was a jolt!\n
I was going to dazzle you with my prize\nPokémon. But your prowess\felectrified me!\n
Yo! I’ve been waiting!\r
I’ll go anywhere if bug Pokémon\nappear there.\r
I see. So you can battle that way.\n
My VENONAT won me the Bug-Catching\nContest at the National Park.\n
As long as I’ve got bug Pokémon, it\ndoesn’t matter how long I have to wait.\fI know I won’t get bored!\r
My boyfriend’s weak, so I can’t rely\non him.\r
Oh, my! You’re so strong!\n
I can count more on my Pokémon than on\nmy boyfriend.\n
Are you going to the Gym? Me, too!\r
Oh. I couldn’t win...\n
The Gym Badges are pretty.\nI collect them.\n
Danger lurks in the night!\r
Whoops!\n
You know, nighttime is fun in its own\nway. But don’t overdo it, OK?\n
Let me guess what you’re thinking!\r
I was wrong.\n
If you read your opponent’s mind, then\nyou can attack more efficiently!\n
I can properly prepare for any\nPokémon adversary!\r
Huh...?\nWas my prediction incorrect?\n
Sniffle... I study for five hours\nstraight every day...\rIf you only read the textbook, I guess\nyou miss out on a lot.\n
I’ve prepared perfectly, waiting\nfor you!\r
Pokémon can’t do a thing if they are\nasleep. I’ll show you how scary that is!\r
I lost. That’s pretty sad...\n
Making Pokémon sleep or paralyzing\nthem are good battle techniques.\n
Tori: Let’s battle!\r
Tori: I lost...\n
Tori: Even though I teamed up with Til,\nwe still lost...\n
Tori: Let’s have a Pokémon battle when\nyou’ve got at least two Pokémon.\n
Til: All right, I’m bringing out\na Pokémon.\r
Til: I lost...\n
Til: Even though Tori tried very hard\nfor me, we still lost...\n
Til: We can’t battle you if you’ve only\ngot one Pokémon...\n
Fly high into the sky, my beloved\nbird Pokémon!\r
I feel like just flying away now.\n
I plan to train in Cianwood City to teach\nmy Pokémon how to Fly.\n
Hey, are you good at Pokémon?\rIf you’re really good, I want you to\nteach me some things.\r
I see. So you can battle that way.\n
I know something good!\rMoomoo Farm’s milk is famous for\nits taste.\n
Oh, here you are again!\nThere’s so many more things I want to\flearn from you!\r
I’ve been overseas, so I know about all\nsorts of Pokémon!\r
Your skill is world class!\n
All kinds of people around the world live\nhappily with Pokémon.\n
Let me try something I learned today.\r
I didn’t study enough, I guess.\n
I have to take so many tests, I don’t\nhave much time for Pokémon.\rSo when I do get to battle, I really\nconcentrate.\n
You’ve come to the right place!\rTime for me to try out everything I’ve\nlearned today!\r
Hi! Aren’t you a cute Trainer!\nMay I see your Pokémon?\r
I’m glad I got to see your Pokémon!\n
When I see Pokémon, it seems to soothe\nmy nerves.\n
Let me see what your Pokémon are\ncapable of.\r
Ooh, your Pokémon have potential.\n
You know how Pokémon have\ndifferent abilities?\rPeople are like that, too. Everyone has\ndifferent potential.\n
Is it OK to brag about my Pokémon?\r
I couldn’t brag...\n
I’m not listening to your bragging!\nWe Pokéfans have a policy of not\flistening to other people brag!\n
I’ve been waiting!\nI’ve been wanting to brag to you!\r\n
Such darling Pokémon. Let’s show our\nPokémon together at the same time.\r
I don’t mind losing.\n
Do you know about baby Pokémon?\nI’ll bet they’re just adorable!\n
I just got back to Olivine.\nSo, how about a Pokémon battle?\r
Awaaargh!\n
My Pokémon were caught and raised\noverseas. They’re my companions on\fthose long voyages.\n
You have to warm up before going into\nthe water.\rThat’s basic.\r
OK! I give up!\n
Cianwood City is a good distance away\nfrom here.\n
Hey, you’re young and fit!\nDon’t ride your Pokémon! Swim!\r
Uh-oh. I lost...\n
Swimming exercises your entire body.\nIt’s healthy.\n
Are you going to Cianwood?\rHow about a quick battle first?\r
I lost that one!\n
I’d say I’m a better swimmer than you.\nYeah!\n
No inflatable tube for me.\nI’m hanging on to a sea Pokémon!\r
Ooh, I’m feeling dizzy!\n
While I float like this, the waves carry\nme along.\n
The water’s warm here. I’m loose and\nlimber. Sure, I’ll take you on!\r
Yikes! I’ve got prune skin!\n
Isn’t it relaxing, just floating\nlike this?\n
I’m a bit tired. If I win, lend me your\nPokémon.\r
Pant, pant...\n
It’s so far to Cianwood. But it’s no\neasy return trip to Olivine either.\fWhat should I do?\n
See those islands that are blocked\nby whirlpools?\fThere just has to be a secret!\r
What’s the secret to your strength?\n
It was a dark and stormy night...\rI saw this giant Pokémon flying from\nthe Whirl Islands.\rFeathers were scattering from its\nsilver wings.\n
The waves are wild here.\nThey tire you out as you swim.\r
I’m beat!\n
The currents keep me from reaching\nthat island.\n
Are you seeking the secrets of the\nWhirl Islands?\r
Ooh, you’ve got great endurance!\n
A secret about the Whirl Islands...\nIt’s pitch black inside!\n
I’m on my way to the Whirl Islands.\nI’m going exploring with friends.\r
Is that how you do it?\n
There’s supposed to be a big Pokémon\ndeep beneath the Whirl Islands.\fI wonder what it could be?\n
You look so elegant riding\nyour Pokémon.\r
I’m crushed...\n
Wasn’t there a hit song about a boy\nriding a LAPRAS?\n
The weather is so beautiful, I’m in\na daze!\r
Ohhh!\n
A sunburn is the worst for skin.\rBut I don’t use sunblock.\nI won’t pollute the water.\n
If you need to rest, just tread water.\nYou’ll get your breath back so you can\fkeep on going strong.\r
Oh! You have more energy than I do.\n
I heard roars from deep inside\nthe islands.\n
At night, STARYU gather near the\nwater’s surface.\r
Oh, dear...\n
The clusters of STARYU light up at the\nsame time. It’s so beautiful,\fit’s scary.\n
Let me demonstrate the power of the\nPokémon I caught!\r
What? That’s not right.\n
I want to become the Trainer Champ\nusing the Pokémon I caught.\fThat’s the best part of fishing!\n
Me? I haven’t been waiting at all.\nI didn’t know that fishing would be\fso boring!\r
Hey!\rThis is my secret place!\nGet lost, you outsider!\r
I should have used my Moon Stone...\n
You’re working on a Pokédex?\rWow, you must know some pretty\nrare Pokémon!\fMay I please see it? Please?\n
What’s the other side of Mt. Mortar\nlike, do you know?\rIf you can beat me, I’ll let you know.\r
Gwah ha ha!\nI lost!\n
I said a pretty boastful lie. I’m sorry!\rThere’s this huge waterfall in the way,\nso I’ve never been on the other side of\fMt. Mortar!\n
I can do so much with my Pokémon!\nIt’s super fun!\r
Losing isn’t fun at all...\n
What is going on at Lake of Rage?\nWe were planning to camp there.\n
I’m in a slump.\rMaybe it’s the gear I’m using.\nLet’s battle for a change of pace!\r
I lost, but I feel better anyway.\n
Kurt’s Lure Ball is the best for\ncatching hooked Pokémon.\rIt’s much more effective than an\nUltra Ball.\n
I love Pokémon!\rThat’s why I started--and why I’ll keep\non collecting Pokémon!\r
How could you do this to me?\n
What else do I like besides Pokémon?\rMary, on the radio. I bet she’s cute!\n
Hey! Do you have any rare Pokémon?\r
Oh, my poor Pokémon! Darlings!\n
I’d be happy just to own a single\nrare Pokémon.\n
I’ve been waiting!\nDid you bring any rare Pokémon\fwith you?\r
Would you get this?\rSome red-haired kid made fun of my\nprecious Pokémon!\rHumph! My Pokémon’s great!\r
My NIDOKING was outstanding!\n
It’s OK for people to like different\ntypes of Pokémon.\rPokémon isn’t just about having the\nmost powerful one.\n
Are you going to Lake of Rage, too?\nLet’s play for a little while!\r
I played too much!\n
I’m having a picnic with Pokémon.\nWon’t you join us?\n
Hey, you’re here!\nLet’s play!\r
Do you know about the legendary\nbird Pokémon?\r
Whew! You’re hot stuff.\n
ARTICUNO, ZAPDOS, and MOLTRES are the\nthree legendary bird Pokémon.\rI heard there are other legendary\nbirds, though.\n
How has it been?\nDid you see the legendary Pokémon?\r
I can tell you’re a good Trainer by\nlooking at you.\rI’m good at Pokémon, and I can see that\nyou are, too.\r
Tch! It’s a total loss on my part.\n
Wow. You have a lot of Badges.\nNo wonder you’re so tough.\rI wonder if Ecruteak Gym’s Morty is\nstill in training?\fHe really hammered me.\n
You look strong.\rGood Trainers seek tough opponents\ninstinctively.\r
Nope! This won’t do at all.\n
We all get better by experiencing many\nbattles. I battled a lot to become what\fI am today--an elite.\n
I’m gonna win for sure!\r
Arrgh... That’s a shocking loss...\n
It’s important to have conviction on\nyour side.\n
Aack! You made me lose a POLIWAG!\nWhat are you going to do about it?\r
Just forget about it.\n
That POLIWAG that got away...\nIt was huge.\rI swear it must’ve been 82 feet long!\n
Hey! I’ve been waiting for you!\r...Oops, maybe I shouldn’t yell so loud.\nThe POLIWAG ran away...\r
I fish until I can’t anymore.\nI also battle until I drop.\fThat’s my relationship with my Pokémon.\r
Hmmmm... This isn’t right.\n
That’s 100 wins to 101 losses.\rI won’t battle again for a while.\n
I’ll do anything to get my hands on\nrare Pokémon!\r
Oooh, your Pokémon are so appealing.\n
If a Pokémon has different colors than\nusual, it’s more valuable.\rWhat? You mean that’s not true?\n
What is your battle strategy?\nIt is foolish to use strong moves\findiscriminately.\r
Fine. I lost.\n
I’m not for overly powerful moves.\rI want to win, but I also don’t want to\nharm Pokémon.\n
What are your thoughts on\nraising Pokémon?\r
You’ve won my respect.\n
I see you’re raising your Pokémon\nwith care.\rThe bond you build will save you in\ntough situations.\n
I was training here alone.\nBehold the result of my hard work!\r
Waaaargh!\n
This calls for extreme measures. I must\ntake to the hills and train in solitude.\n
I’ve been studying while waiting for you\nto come back...\rLet me show you the results!\r
Be prepared for anything!\fLet me see if your Pokémon have been\nraised properly!\r
Oh, I lost that!\n
I’ll head back to Blackthorn’s Ice Path\nand train some more.\n
Yo! You’re tough! But you know what?\nWhen it comes to sheer toughness,\fI’m the man!\r
My Pokémon weren’t tough enough!\n
Boy, do I love HP Up! Mmmm, yum!\rI keep drinking my Pokémon’s!\nI can’t help it!\n
My Pokémon are power packed!\r
Wahahah!\nI’m the big loser!\n
I’m not much good at thinking, see?\nSo I just plow ahead with power!\n
I’ve been waiting!\r
Why do I climb mountains?\nBecause they’re there.\rWhy do I train Pokémon?\nBecause they’re there!\r
Losses...\nThey’re there, too!\n
The best thing ever to happen to me was\ndiscovering Pokémon.\n
I’m raising Pokémon, too!\nWill you battle with me?\r
Wha...?\n
I did my best but came up short.\nNo excuses--I admit I lost.\n
Awright! I’ll show you the power of\nmountain Pokémon!\r
Mercy! You showed me your power!\n
It’s over. I don’t mind. We Hikers are\nlike that.\n
I raise Pokémon, too!\nWill you battle with me?\r
Oh, bleah!\n
If you’ve promised to have a rematch,\nyour opponent’s location will be marked\fwith an “!” on the map.\rYou can check it on your Pokégear.\n
Hey, have you gone and visited many\nGyms since then?\r
Oh, you are truly strong.\n
Oh, so close! I almost had you.\n
I don’t have any Pokémon left...\n
Oh, you are wonderful...\n
Ooh, you’re good at Pokémon, too.\n
Looks like I lost...\n
If a Trainer spots another Trainer,\nhe or she has to make a challenge.\fThat is our destiny.\r
Whew...\nGood battle.\n
Pokémon and their Trainer become\npowerful through constant battling.\n
The red GYARADOS?\nThat sounds scary.\fIt must be red with rage!\fMe?\rI’m not angry or anything, but\nlet’s battle!\r
Good going!\n
Come to think of it, I’ve seen a\npink BUTTERFREE.\n
Let me battle with the Pokémon\nI just caught!\r
I might be an expert angler, but I stink\nas a Pokémon Trainer...\n
I won’t lose as an angler! I catch\nPokémon all day.\n
No matter what I do, all I catch are\nthe same Pokémon...\r
My line’s all tangled up...\n
Why can’t I catch any good Pokémon?\n
Are you alone?\nThen let’s battle!\r
That’s too much to handle!\n
I wonder if there are any mountains\nworth climbing in Kanto?\n
I’m going to Kanto to put on\nfire-breathing shows!\r
Fizzle... The flame’s tiny...\n
I guess fire is weak on the sea...\nIt doesn’t matter? Really?\n
Hey, kid! Want to battle with me?\r
You’re strong!\n
You’re traveling all alone?\nIsn’t your mom worried?\n
You think I’m a baby?\nThat’s not fair!\r
Oh! We lost!
Baby is a rude name to call someone!
You’ve got only one Pokémon?\nThen I’m not battling with you.
I’m not a baby!\nThat’s not a nice thing to say!\r
Oh! We lost!\n
Sometimes, kids are smarter\nthan grown-ups!\n
If you don’t bring more Pokémon, then\nyou can’t play with everyone.\n
Urrf...\nI’m seasick!\r
I can’t move anymore...\n
No more ships for me. Next time, I’m\ntaking the Magnet Train.\n
Nothing beats a battle when I’m on\nmy break.\r
Win or lose, my break’s over!\n
I guess I can’t win if I don’t\nget serious.\n
I’m so bored.\nWant to battle?\r
Yow! You’re too strong!\n
Saffron, Celadon... I hear there are\nmany big cities in Kanto.\n
Oh, no. I’ve lost something that’s\nvery important.\r
I...I can’t find it...\n
I give up. You don’t have to look.\nJust forget about it!\n
I’m going to Kanto to test my skills.\r
I wanted to win!\n
Trainers from Johto can battle with\nKanto Gym Leaders.\n
I’m training to become the Champion!\r
What’s so different between us?\n
I’m going to beat you someday!\n
I’m trying to forget my woes.\nLet’s battle!\r
My heart weeps...\n
A voyage is best for getting over a\nbroken heart. But a Fast Ship trip is\ftoo short for grieving.\n
Ssh! My brain is picking up\nradio signals!\r
...I hear something!\n
It seems that Johto’s radio shows\ntalk about Kanto when you are\fin Kanto...\n
What kinds of Poké Balls do you have\nwith you?\r
Wait! Stop! Don’t!\nPlease!\n
You should use the right Poké Balls to\nfit the situation.\n
I’m building up my legs by bracing\nagainst the ship’s rocking!\r
Rocked and rolled over!\n
I couldn’t find the Karate King in\nJohto. He’s supposed to be training in a\fcave somewhere.\n
Even though we’re out on the sea,\nI can’t fish! This is boring!\fLet’s battle!\r
I...I’m not bored anymore...\n
I plan to fish off Vermilion’s pier.\n
This is where we sailors work!\r
I lost on my home field...\n
We get different passengers from\nVermilion City to Olivine City.\n
Yeehaw!\nLucky!\r
How unlucky!\nI lost!\n
I found a pretty coin here. \nSomeone must have lost it...\n
Do you know Mary?\nShe’s a popular DJ in Johto.\r
Gyaaaah!\n
Mary’s the best!\nI want to be a DJ, too!\n
I’m visiting my grandma to catch me\nsome bugs!\r
Ooh, wow!\nYou’re tough!\n
I’ll catch all the Pokémon you can find\nonly in Johto!\n
I’m going to audition my songs at\nGoldenrod’s Radio Tower.\r
Yowza!\nTotal distortion!\n
Speaking of the Radio Tower, what is\nBuena’s password for today?\n
What do you think? My Pokémon are\nbeautiful, yes?\r
Oh, no! My beautiful Pokémon!\n
I must take them to the Pokémon Salon\nand get them fixed up nice!\n
I’m going to shop at the Dept. Store\nand then...\r
What was I going to do?\n
Oh, yes! I have to get my Pokémon out\nof Day Care!\n
Don’t lay a finger on my students!\r
Aaack!\n
We’re on a school trip to the ruins\noutside Violet.\n
Do you know the Ruins of Alph?\r
Yaargh!\n
Radios pick up strange signals inside\nthe ruins.\n
There are some odd stone panels in the\nRuins of Alph.\r
I was taken down!\n
I read that there are four of those\nstone panels.\n
I’m a sailor man!\rBut I’m training Pokémon, so I can\nbecome the Champion!\r
My lack of training is obvious...\n
Those Badges you’re carrying...\nLet me guess.\rThose are the ones you get when you\ndefeat Gym Leaders, right?\rThat means you’re pretty strong!\n
We stand guard in this tower.\rHere, we express our gratitude to\nshow our respect for all Pokémon.\r
Th-thank you!\n
All living beings coexist through\ncooperation.\rWe must always be thankful for this.\n
However hard we battle, the tower will\nstand strong.\r
I fought hard, but I’m too weak.\n
The flexible pillar protects the tower,\neven from earthquakes.\n
I train to find enlightenment\nin Pokémon!\r
This little squirt sure made me hurt!\n
As Pokémon grow stronger, so does\nthe Trainer.\rNo, wait. As the Trainer grows\nstronger, so do the Pokémon.\n
Let me see how much you trust\nyour Pokémon.\r
Yes, your trust is real!\n
It is not far to the Elder.\n
I sway like leaves in the wind...\r
Oh, I’m weak!\n
I tried to copy BELLSPROUT’s gentle\nmovements for battle...\rBut I didn’t train well enough.\n
The Elder’s TM lights even\npitch-black darkness.\r
It is my head that is bright!\n
Let there be light on your journey.\n
So good of you to come here!\rSprout Tower is a place of training.\nPeople and Pokémon test their bonds\fto build a bright future together.\fI am the final test.\rAllow me to check the ties between\nyou and your Pokémon!
Ah, excellent!\n
You and your Pokémon should have no\nproblem using this move.\rTake this Flash TM.\n
I’m practicing my fire breathing in the\nBurned Tower! Don’t try this at home!\r
Pfooosh... Pfooosh... Pffffoooom...\n
Oops, please don’t misunderstand!\nI’m not the reason that this tower is\fburned up!\n
Don’t worry!\nWe fire-breathers know the true power\fof fire better than anyone!\r
Thanks for such a heated battle!\n
The reason this tower’s burned is\nthat it was hit by lightning.\rThe fire I’m breathing is tiny\nin comparison...\n
We adore our Pokémon, even if they\ndislike us. That’s what being a\fPokéfan is all about.\r
M-my Pokémon!\n
I lost the battle, but my Pokémon win\nthe prize for being the most lovely.\n
My Pokémon is simply darling.\nLet me tell you how proud my\fdarling makes me.\r
I can beat you in pride, but...\n
I must say, your Pokémon are quite\ncute, too.\n
I’ve been waiting here to brag to you\nabout my Pokémon!\r
Hello? Why are you staring at me?\rOh, a battle?\r
...Hmmm...\n
I thought I did something wrong\nbecause you kept staring at me.\n
What?\nStaring at people’s faces.\r...Oh, didn’t I make a promise to\nsomeone? Was that you?\r
The world is deep. There are still lots\nof things we don’t know.\fBut I know more than you do!\r
Wh-wh-what?\n
There is a lot to learn.\rFor example...\nThere are more than 90 kinds of TMs.\fAnd traded Pokémon level up faster.\n
Yay!\nYou kept your promise and came back!\r
Y-you’re strong...\n
Three years ago, Team Rocket was\nforced to disband.\rBut we’re making a comeback here!\r
Gwah! Don’t get cute!\n
We won’t let you ruin our plans for\nour comeback!\n
We’re Team Rocket!\nWe like to cause trouble!\rOoh! Are you scared?\r
You think you’re a hero?\n
We’re not always evil. We just do\nwhatever we like.\n
Hey, hey! Keep out of our way!\r
Arggh. I give up.\n
Our Executives are trying to take this\nplace over. They have some big plan.\fI wonder what it is.\n
Ha ha ha!\fHow boring. It was far too easy to take\nover this place!\rCome on, keep me amused!\r
Wh-who are you?\n
You beat me, and I won’t forget it!\n
An unknown child wandering here?\nWho are you?\r
Tch! I took you too lightly!\n
Bwahahaha...\rI can transmit as strong a signal as\nI need from here.\n
I’ve been given strict orders.\rI’m to crush anyone who challenges\nTeam Rocket!\r
!!!\n
I failed in my duties...\nI’ll be docked pay for this...\n
It feels great ordering Pokémon to\ncommit crimes.\r
You’re kidding!\n
I feel lousy over losing! Bah!\nI hate useless Pokémon!\n
Why did the door open? Did you have\nsomething to do with this?\r
Gulp! This is a bleak moment.\n
What?! You made it past our men in\nthe Underground? How could you have?\n
Proton: Now, wait just one second!\rAren’t you the one who got in\nour way at the SLOWPOKE Well?\rI see... You’re doing all this because\nyou want to make me angry. Be careful!\rBut since you seem to wish it, I’ll show\nyou the full extent of a Team Rocket\fExecutive’s wrath!\r
Seriously, you’d chase me this far?!\n
Ugh... What are you?!\n
Phew...\n
Proton: You may have won this time...\nBut all you did was make Team Rocket’s\fwrath grow...\n
Most excellent!\rThis Radio Tower will fulfill our\ngrand design.\r
Hmmm...\nAll grand plans come with snags.\n
Do you honestly believe you can stop\nTeam Rocket?\n
You plan to rescue the Director?\nSo sad that won’t be possible--\fbecause I’m going to beat you!\r
No! Unbelievable!\n
I do not believe it! I was beaten!\n
Oh, no! They’re so useless!\n
What? Am I losing?\n
Hey, wait, are you serious?!\n
OK, OK. I’ll tell you where he is.\n
Ariana: Hey, you...\nRemember me from the hideout in\fMahogany Town?\rThis time...\rHee hee hee. This time...it looks like\nyou’re really all alone. All alone...\rSo it should be quite easy.\nBring it! Let’s finish this!\r\n
Hey, what do you think you’re doing?!\n
Wh... Wha... Why are you so strong?!\n
Aaaieeeee!\nThis can’t be happening!\rI fought hard, but I still lost...\n
What a waste...\nnot to use your strength to do\fbad things!\rFeh... People like you will never in a\nmillion years understand our brilliance!\rIt’s too bad... I’ve really come to\nrespect your strength.\n
We can’t have you getting in the way\nbefore news of our resurgence\freaches Giovanni!\n
That’s impossible...\n
No!\nForgive me, Giovanni!\n
Hmmm...\nThis is a strange place.\r
...\n
I like thinking here.\n
ZUBAT’s Supersonic keeps confusing my\nPokémon. I’m seriously upset\fabout that!\r
I flamed out!\n
I’ve practiced training my Pokémon,\nbut I’ve practiced breathing fire many\fmore times than that.\rDon’t try this at home, OK?\n
If there’s light, a cave isn’t scary. If\nyou’re strong, Pokémon aren’t scary.\r
FLASH!\n
It’s my Pokémon’s fire that lights up\nthis cave.\n
I roam far and wide in search of\nPokémon.\rAre you looking for Pokémon, too?\nThen you’re my collecting rival!\r
Ugh. My poor Pokémon...\n
Every Friday, you can hear Pokémon\nroars from deep inside the cave.\n
You’re headed to Azalea, are you?\nLet my Pokémon see if you are good\fenough to battle.\r
Oh, oh, oh!\n
All right, then! I’ve decided.\rI’m not leaving until my Pokémon\nget tougher!\n
Whoa! What a surprise!\nI didn’t expect to see anyone here!\r
Whoa! I’m beaten big time!\n
I was conned into buying a\nSlowpokeTail. I feel sorry for the\fpoor Pokémon.\n
Who’s there?\nLeave me and my Pokémon alone!\r
Go...\nGo away!\n
Just me and my Pokémon.\nI’m delirious with joy.\n
I came all the way here to conduct my\nPokémon research.\rLet me demonstrate my findings in a\nreal battle!\r
I’m the one who learned something from\nyour demonstration!\n
I should compile and announce my study\nfindings. I might even become famous\flike Professor Elm.\n
It’s been a while since I last saw\nanother person.\rDon’t be shy. Let’s battle!\r
Uurggh...\n
I’ve been lost for a long time...\rI don’t mind it here, but I am\nsoooo hungry!\n
What do you know!\nA visitor!\r
Wa ha ha! You’re a feisty one!\n
I live down here.\nIf you like, you can always come visit!\n
There are two kinds of people:\nthose with style and those without.\rWhich kind of person are you?\r
You’ve got dazzling style!\n
Your Pokémon style is stunning and\nfull of life, I admit.\rYou’ll just keep getting better!\n
I’m in training.\nCare for a round?\r
Aww, no! You’re too good for me.\n
I’m going to train by myself until\nI improve.\n
If the Pokémon I liked were there,\nI’d go anywhere.\rThat’s what a real Trainer does.\r
I’d rather pet my Pokémon than battle!\n
Just once a week, a Pokémon comes to\nthe water’s edge.\rI wanted to see that Pokémon...\n
It doesn’t matter where we go, there’s\nalways someone who doesn’t agree\fwith us...\n
Are you serious? Did you come here\nthinking you could mess with our plans?\n
Grr...\nFor a kid to be this good...\fI didn’t see it coming.\n
Quit taking SlowpokeTails?\rIf we listened to you, Team Rocket’s\nrep would be ruined!\r
Just...\nToo strong...\n
We need the money, but selling\nSlowpokeTails?\rIt’s tough being a Team Rocket Grunt!\n
Humph! I was standing guard up top\nwhen some old coot yelled at me.\rHe startled me so much that I fell\ndown here.\rHow about I vent my anger and take it\nout on you!\r
Arrgh! This is NOT my day!\n
Sure, we’ve been hacking the tails off\nSLOWPOKE and selling them.\rTeam Rocket will do anything for money!\n
Stop taking SlowpokeTails?\rWhat?! You want us to disobey a direct\norder from Executive Proton?\rIf you want to stop us, you’ll have to\ndefeat us all! Go ahead and try!\r
You rotten brat!\n
SlowpokeTails grow back fast!\rBesides, it was an order from Proton,\nso I’m more concerned about that!\n
What are you here for? Just to stand\naround and gawk? I suggest you leave!\r
You really are concerned...\n
How in the world do you go up?\rI want to visit the sick Pokémon, but I\ncan’t get up there...\n
We’re pretty high up here. My bird\nPokémon are in prime form.\r
Oops...\nThey crashed...\n
My bird Pokémon trained in Cianwood.\nSince I’ve lost, maybe we’ll go across\fthe sea.\n
I travel the world to train my Pokémon.\nNow, I wish to battle with you.\r
...Aww... I must train some more...\n
Jasmine used to use Rock Pokémon\nlike ONIX.\n
Eh? This is no place for playing.\r
Ah! I can see you’re serious.\n
Up top is a Pokémon that keeps the\nLighthouse lit.\rPokémon glow when they are healthy,\njust like people.\n
Hey, you’re back!\r
Jasmine is this city’s Gym Leader.\nI intend to bring her back with me.\rNobody better get in my way!\r
Aaack! My Pokémon!\n
Right. Anybody would be worried if his or\nher own Pokémon were hurt.\n
Men of the sea are always spoiling for a\ngood fight!\r
Urf!\nI lose!\n
What power! How would you like to sail\nthe seas with me?\n
Hey, you’re back!\nJust in time for me to show off!\r
Sailors are both kind and strong.\nHow about you?\r
You are both kind and strong...\n
Every time I come back to Olivine,\nI visit the Gym.\rThe Gym Leader’s Pokémon type\nchanged without my noticing.\n
Jasmine must be worried sick about the\nPokémon here. She won’t even smile\fthese days.\r
I can’t manage a smile, either...\n
Speaking of being sick, I’ve heard\nthere’s a good Pharmacy in Cianwood.\n
I wanted to battle Jasmine, but she’s\nnot up to it now. So how about you?\r
Whoa, whoa. You’re overwhelming!\n
Being a Gym Leader isn’t just about\nbeing strong. A Leader also needs to\fbe compassionate.\n
This was once a ninja hideout.\rThere are traps to confound intruders\nlike you.\r
I see...\n
The PC on my desk is the switch\nthat deactivates the PERSIAN\falarm system.\rDon’t you ever touch it, OK?\n
Heh heh. Feeling lucky, punk?\rGo ahead, take another step.\nWe’ve got explosives set in the floor!\fStep on one, and--BOOM!\r
Kaboom!\n
Where are the traps planted?\nThat... Well...\rI don’t even remember!\n
Grr... I failed...\n
Surveillance cams are in the\nPokémon statues.\rWe’ll keep appearing until you trip a\nsecret switch.\n
Argh! I’m getting nervous!\n
Eeek!\n
Tch, you really are strong.\rIt’s too bad. If you were to join Team\nRocket, you could become an Executive.\n
The door won’t open?\rWell, duh. It has to have a password\nthat only Team Rocket knows.\r
What? I lost?\n
Heh, I’m just a Team Rocket Grunt.\nI don’t know the password.\fToo bad for you.\n
Oh, a kid? I don’t really like this, but\neliminate you I must.\r
I knew I’d lose...\n
I got wiped out on the last mission by a\nkid, too. When we were abducting\fPokémon, this kid with long red hair and\fmean-looking eyes just whomped me...\n
You rotten little pest!\r
Grrrr...\n
Heh, only the one who guards the boss’s\nroom knows the password for that door.\rWhere’s the boss’s room?\nWho knows? Go look for yourself.\n
...\n
Hey, you’re good!\n
Wow, strong!\n
I...I couldn’t do a thing...\nGiovanni, please forgive me...\n
I used to work for Silph, but now I run\nresearch for Team Rocket.\rA meddlesome child like you needs to be\npunished.\r
A mere tactical error cost me...\n
A radio signal that drives Pokémon\nmad... My experiment is a complete\fsuccess. My promotion is assured.\fThis loss means absolutely nothing.\n
I don’t care that Pokémon are hurt by\nour experiment.\r
Thinking is my strong suit, not battling.\n
If we turn up the power of our radio\nsignal for broadcast nationwide...\rThe very thought excites me!\n
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\rYou’re challenging me to a battle?\nHah! You’re nuts, but you have guts!\rI like that! If you can beat me, I’ll\ntell you a password to the boss’s room!\r
The password for the boss’s door--\rRATICATETAIL.\n
The password for the boss’s door--\nRATICATETAIL.\rBut if you don’t have both passwords...\nHa ha ha!\n
Do I know the password?\rMaybe.\rBut no weakling’s going to get it!\r
The password for the boss’s door--\rSLOWPOKETAIL.\n
The password to the boss’s room is\nSLOWPOKETAIL.\rBut it’s useless unless you have two\npasswords.\n
My Pokémon just got a haircut!\nI’ll show you how strong it is!\r
Aiyeeee!\n
Your Pokémon will like you more if you\ngive them haircuts.\n
I think you have some rare Pokémon\nwith you. Let me see them!\r
Gah! I lost!\nThat makes me mad!\n
Are you making a Pokédex?\nHere’s a hot tip.\rYou want to battle as many Trainers as\nyou can when you see them on routes\fand in caves.\rTheir Pokémon will be recorded in the\nPokédex, and they’ll also make your\fPokémon grow!\n
I got booted out of the Game Corner.\nI kept winning at the new Coin game,\fand they thought I was cheating...\r
...Grumble...\n
I guess I have to do things fair\nand square...\n
Do you consider the Pokémon types\nin battle?\rIf you know about the different types\nof Pokémon, you’ll do better in battle.\r
Ow, ow, ow!\n
I know all the different types\nof Pokémon.\fBut I only use one type.\n
Fork over your goods!\r
Mercy!\n
Steal and sell!\nThat’s basic in crime, kid!\n
They ditched this project before\nthey finished.\fI’m searching for leftover loot.\r
So strong...\n
The underground warehouse?\rWhat do you want to go there for?\nThere’s nothing down there.\n
Open one door, another closes. Bet you\ncan’t get where you want to go!\r
Uh-oh! I was sunk by indecision!\n
I’m confused, too...\rI’m pretty sure that the green switch\nis the one to press last... I think?\n
I don’t care if you’re lost. You show up\nhere--you’re nothing but a victim!\r
Urk! Yeah, think you’re cool, huh?\n
You must have ice in your veins to\ncall out Team Rocket.\n
Kwa ha ha!\rConfounded by the doors, are we?\rI’ll let you in on a secret if you can\nbeat me!\r
Uwww...\nI blew it.\n
All right. A hint!\rLook at the color of the door switches.\nYou push a color switch, and the same\fcolor door opens up...\n
Are you lost? No, you can’t be.\nYou don’t have that scared look. I’ll\fgive you something to be scared about!\r
How could you?\n
Go wherever you like! Get lost!\nSee if I care!\n
You’re not going any farther!\nI don’t show mercy to my enemies,\fespecially not brats!\r
Blast it!\n
I lost...\rPlease forgive me, Giovanni!\n
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nI remember you!\rYou got me good at our hideout!\r
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nSo that’s how you did it!\n
Hyuck-hyuck-hyuck!\nThat was a blast!\n
How did you get this far? I guess it\ncan’t be helped. I’ll dispose of you.\r
I got disposed of...\n
Team Rocket will keep going, waiting for\nthe return of Giovanni.\rWe’ll do whatever it takes.\n
Waaaarggh!\nI’m beaten!\n
You! How dare you enter uninvited!\r
S-strong!\n
The Shrine ahead is home to the Master\nof our Dragon Tamer clan.\rYou’re not allowed to just go in!\n
You shouldn’t be in here!\r
Oh yikes, I lost!\n
Soon I’m going to get permission from\nour Master to use dragons.\rWhen I do, I’m going to become an\nadmirable Dragon Tamer and gain our\fMaster’s approval.\n
It’s a stranger--someone we\ndon’t know.\r
Ouchies.\n
It was like having to battle Lance.\n
We fight as a team. Come back later with\nmore Pokémon.\n
Who are you?\r
Meanie.\n
We’ll tell on you.\rMaster will be angry with you.\n
You don’t have enough Pokémon.\nCome back when you have more.\n
...!\n
...\n
Welcome to Viridian Forest.\nEnjoy my Bug-type Pokémon!\r
That’s wonderful...\n
Pretty impressive!\rI’m sure you can go anywhere with\nthat skill!\n
Shh! Be quiet!\nThe bug Pokémon will run away!\r
Phew...\n
From Bug-type Pokémon come the sounds\nof munching on grass, walking on\fcrunchy leaves, swimming in puddles...\rFor bug Pokémon fans, knowing how to\ndistinguish these sounds is key!\n
Wow, that’s a HUGE Pokémon!\r...\n...What kind of Trainer?!\r
I couldn’t catch it!\n
Has anyone ever told you that from\nbehind you look like a VENONAT?\n
I’m sure that there’s nothing more\nefficient and beautiful in this world\fthan a Bug-type Pokémon.\r
I lost beautifully!\n
If this is it, then I don’t mind losing!\n
There are many people out there who\nprefer solid bug Pokémon over squishy\fbug Pokémon.\r
Thanks for your hard work,\nmy lovely Pokémon...\n
Doesn’t matter what kind of Pokémon--\fas long as you like them, they all\nlook cute.\n\n
What did you come all the way out here\nfor, I wonder.\r
I lost all the way out here...\n
Trainers are everywhere.\n
Hey, hey, you’re in my way!\nRight!\r
I got kicked around...\n
All right, please pass through!\n
To beat the cold, try warm clothes and\na hot drink!\r
Argh, all the way out here!\n
That was a hot battle!\n
How do I feel about losing?\nIt hurts!\n
I’m not done measuring data!\n
I-I didn’t win.\n
It’s pure white in my head!\n
Argh... I can’t do any more...\n
Argh!\n
You!\nI’ve been waiting for someone like you!\r
Yep, just as strong as expected!\n
That was a great fight!\nDon’t you agree?\n
Right after learning it in class, I head\noutside to practice!\r
I need to follow the textbook.\n
I should be sure to record all of\ntoday’s mistakes in a notebook!\n
My Bag is digging into my shoulders!\nWhen that happens, I like to take a\fbreak and have a battle!\r
Feh.\n
All right, guess I should carry my\nBag again!\n
How about you just slow down\nand give me the chance to defeat you!\r
Looks like I’ve been beaten at my\nown game...\n
Even though you’re so young, you\nhave the spirit of battle within.\rYou must have trained under a\nwell-known master!\n
Zac: Really, you want to battle us?\nYou’ve got a lot of courage for someone\fso young.\r
Zac: You weren’t bluffing...\n
Zac: Your future looks promising.\n
Zac: You... Please come back with\nmore Pokémon.\n
Jen: Huh? You’d like to go up against\nus? Great!\r
Jen: You’re so much stronger than\nI thought.\n
Jen: I’m looking forward to seeing what\nkind of Trainer you’ll become.\n
Jen: If you’re looking to battle us,\nyou have to have at least two Pokémon.\n
Wait a moment! Come fight us!\r
You did it...\n
You came all the way from Johto?\nYou must be very persistent!\n
Peace!\r...\n...Huh?\rWhen you meet the unknown on a\nmountain road, all you want is peace,\fright?\r
Peace--even though I lost!\n
Exchanging lighthearted greetings with\nsomeone you don’t know...\rThat’s the best thing about mountains!\n
Youngster? Goodness, how rude!\nCall me Shorts Boy!\r
That is...Fail Boy...\n
Looks like I need a bit more training!\n
Moe: Do I look weak?\nDon’t make me laugh!\fWhen I’m with Lulu, I’ve got a hundred\ftimes more courage!\r
Moe: Uwaaaahhh...\n
Moe: In short, you’re just\ntoo strong...\n
Moe: You don’t have enough Pokémon to\nfight with us.\n
Lulu: Moe and I make a great pair! You\nshould prepare yourself!\r
Lulu: Eeek!\n
Lulu: Don’t you misunderstand this!\nIt’s not that Moe’s weak, it’s that\fyou’re too strong!\n
Lulu: Uh-oh, you’ve got only one\nPokémon. You can’t battle with us\flike that!\n
I am but a Gentleman stopped on the\nroad. Would you care to join me in a\fquick contest?\r
You were very skillful.\n
Stopping in the road for a battle isn’t\nrude. No matter what, I am a\fGentleman first!\n
Huh? The wind has changed direction!\r
Phew...\n
Since the wind has changed,\nI’ll lay low...\n
BASABASABASABASABASA!\r
Pyopyopyopyo...\n
Chuun-Chuun? Chunchun!\n
Vic: All right! I’ll be able to show off\nfor Tara!\r
Vic: Oh no, my plans!\n
Vic: Tara’s already seen\nme humiliated...\n
Vic: What is it? You want to battle?\nIf you want to battle with us, you need\fmore Pokémon, right?\n
Tara: I love to look at my boyfriend’s\nface in profile while he’s battling!\r
Tara: Oh no, oh no...\n
Tara: Even though my boyfriend lost,\nhe’s still wonderful.\n
Tara: Oh? You’ve got only one Pokémon?\nOK, we’ll try again another time.\n
Pokémon battles lure people in!\r
My Pokémon bucket is empty!\n
Really? Rather than always catching new\nPokémon, it’s good to train them?\n\n
It was nice talking to you, but now I’m\nhere for a Pokémon battle!\r
Tim: I’ll give you a little hint.\rDon’t you think my girlfriend’s much\nstronger than I am?\r
Tim: You’re the strongest!\n
Tim: If you’ve beaten her, you must\nbe strong!\n
Tim: Are you collecting Pokémon? You\ncan’t fight us with just one Pokémon.\n
Tim: Hey, you came back! \nWhile we were waiting for you, we became\fmuch stronger!\rWell, she did.\r
Sue: Women who don’t take love\nseriously and who are reckless might\fget hurt.\r
Sue: Wa ha...\n
Sue: That strength of yours...\rI’ve got it! Are you in love?\n
Sue: Let’s have a Pokémon battle after\nyou’ve gotten more than one Pokémon.\n
Sue: A woman in love is impatient.\rBut if she’s with her boyfriend,\nwaiting is never a chore!\r
Collect water!\nDon’t let the fire go out!\fLook out for wild Pokémon!\fLet’s go, Campfire!\r
Pfuuuuhh...\n
It doesn’t matter what kind of\npreparation you’ve done.\fIf you lose, you lose.\n
I can fit in a quick battle while I’m in\nthe midst of preparing a meal!\r
Oh, I’m hungry...\n
I figured it would be easy to knock\nyou out...\n
Hey, you’re back! I haven’t eaten\nanything while I waited!\r
Hey, hey, how about we bring out your\nPokémon and mine for a battle?\r
Oh, that’s too bad...\n
The way you were walking with your\nPokémon made me think that I could win.\n
Why is it I always get the urge to\nwhistle when walking through nature?\r
Tweeee!\n
Instead of communicating with Pokémon\nwith words, you can communicate with\fthem through whistling!\n
All right, let’s get this Pokémon\nbattle started!\r
All right!\nThat concludes today’s battle.\n
Don’t relax just ’cause you won.\nOnce you get home, you should do a\ffull review!\n
My weight puts me in the\nfeatherweight class!\r...Huh? What do you mean that\ndoesn’t sound very strong?\r
I lost as lightly as a feather floats!\n
Maybe I should lie and say I’m in the\nheavyweight class...\n
I’m a stubborn featherweight.\nI’ve been waiting here for you!\r
I can’t wait to go home and drop off\nmy Bag!\r
I was in too much of a hurry.\n
Don’t rush, and take the road one step\nat a time. Great advice!\n
It’s good to put what you learn to\nuse immediately!\r
I see. I see.\n
All right!\nNext time, I won’t make any mistakes!\n
I’ve made good use of the time I’ve\nbeen waiting and done a review!\r
Do you have after-school\nstudy sessions?\r
So strong...\n
Maybe I should join your\nstudy sessions!\n
We’re the twins Kay and Tia!\nDo you know which one I am?\r
Tia and Kay both lost...\n
Absolute truth--I’m Kay! Maybe...\n
If you want to battle with us,\nyou’ll need to bring more Pokémon!\n
While you weren’t looking, Kay and Tia\nchanged places.\r
We’re the twins Kay and Tia!\nDo you know which one I am?\r
Kay and Tia both lost...\n
Maybe truth--I’m Tia! Absolutely!\n
If you want to battle with us,\nyou’ll need to bring more Pokémon!\n
While you weren’t looking, Tia and Kay\nchanged places.\r
Hey, your Pokémon...\nShow me. Show me. Show me!\r
Yay! That was great!\n
When you battle Pokémon, you get to\nsee a bunch of Pokémon you’ve never\fseen before. It’s so great!\n
All right, Pokémon, time for a battle!\r
Oh, well...\n
It’s not that my Pokémon are weak!\nIt’s that your Pokémon are too strong!\n
You’re gonna lose!\nI’ve got a hunch!\r
Maybe my hunch was a little off...\n
You’re so cool!\nYou don’t do anything halfway!\n
Modding my Bike costs a bunch of money!\nI need a job!\r
Argh. I failed!\n
Bike?\nOh, I was talking about my Bicycle!\n
Hey, who told you you could ride up\nand down this road?\r
Crash!\n
See you later! Come back anytime!\n
Hey! Do you think you could just pass\nthrough here without stopping?\r
Parara parapara para-parara!\rMy horn’s got a great melody to it,\ndon’t you think?\r
Paaraaraaaaa...\n
I love this melancholy melody.\nIt really suits me well...\n
I’ll toughen you up.\nNow, you come along with me.\r
All right, thanks!\n
All right! That fighting yell was great!\n
Hey hey hey!\nYou’re in my way! IN MY WAY!\r
I lost. I lost!\n
Won’t you give it a try? Would you like\nto join my team?\n
Hey, that’s a cool Bike\nyou’re riding!\r
Great job.\n
I love the way you do battle, too!\nConsider me a fan!\n
Vroom vroom!\nBaribaribaribaribari!\fWhat do you think of my engine imitation?\r
Hnnff...hnnff... I’m out of breath...\n
We don’t put out any exhaust fumes.\nWe’re a biker club that’s kind\fto nature!\n
Gaon gaooon!\nBuwaribaribaribari...!\fThere, my engine imitation has evolved!\r
Have you ever gone camping\nwith Pokémon?\r
You’re strong!\n
If you forget your blanket when you go\ncamping, you can snuggle up to a\fPokémon and it’ll be just as warm!\n
Are you in a hurry?\nHow about a quick battle break?\r
Aaahh...that’s it.\n
Even though I lost, I had fun!\n
When I was a kid, I only played inside\nthe house.\rNow I love playing outside with Pokémon!\r
Argh!\n
If I’m with Pokémon, I don’t mind losing\nso much!\n
Found it! A Trainer that I can\nenjoy fighting!\r
I lost with all my strength!\n
That was an incredible battle!\nI’ve got goose bumps!\n
Hey, hey. Will you battle me?\r
That was pretty incredible.\n
You’re something special!\n
I used to be a fisherman a while back.\rI’ve grown to love swimming so much,\nI’m always in my swim trunks!\r
Ulp...\n
Maybe I should go back to fishing...\n
Phew!\nI’ve worn my best swim trunks today!\r
Even if you’re wearing your best pants,\nif you don’t win--you just don’t win.\n
All right! Next time I’ll wear party\nswim trunks!\n
Look! It’s my very best swimsuit\nand my very best Pokémon!\r
Ohhh!\n
Your Pokémon--are you following the\nlatest trend in teams?\n
Mmph? Mmmph mmmmphh?\nMmmmph mmmmmppphh!!!\r
Pwah!\n
I was trying to see how long I could\nhold my breath!\n
Huh? I’ve caught a Trainer\ninstead of a Pokémon!\r
My fishing line got cut!\n
It’s said that the Pokémon that\nescaped were huge. It’s the truth!\n
Whoa! A nibble!\r...Huh?\nA battle? OK, let’s go!\r
If you try to chase two Pokémon,\nyou won’t catch either one!\n
I should’ve asked you to wait until\nI reeled that Pokémon in...\n
Question is...did I become a fisherman\nbecause I’m patient, or did I get more\fpatient because I’m a fisherman?\r
Ummm... Hmmm...\n
What’s the reason you became a\nPokémon Trainer?\n
I love bikinis!\nIf I had an electric bikini, I could wear\fit even in winter!\r
Awww...\n
I suppose if you tried to swim in an\nelectric bikini, you’d get a shock!\n
Hey, Trainer! How about you put on a\nswimsuit, too?\r
I didn’t want to lose...\n
I wonder if there’s any place that sells\nswimsuits that suit my Pokémon?\n
The teacher from the swimming class\nwhere I learned to swim had a face just\flike a POLIWHIRL.\r
I’m sorry, Teacher...\n
Due to the incredible resemblance,\nwe called our teacher\fProfessor POLIWHIRL!\n
Swimming is a full-body exercise, so it’s\nreally good for building strength!\r
My Pokémon and I have no\nbody strength...\n
To win more, I need to work on\nmy stamina!\n
Surrounding yourself with bird Pokémon\ngives you the feeling that someday you\fmight be able to fly, too!\r
I couldn’t fly...\n
I guess I just need to practice flapping\nmy wings more!\n
Bird Keepers are so wonderful with\ntheir bird Pokémon!\r
I couldn’t handle it...\n
We Bird Keepers think we’re using bird\nPokémon. But somewhere along the line,\fthe bird Pokémon started using us...\n\n
Day: Are you going to beat us?\r
Day: Waah!\n
Day: You beat us...\n
Day: If you want to battle Pokémon\nwith us, you’ll have to bring more...\n
Dani: We’ll knock you flat!\r
Dani: Eeeeh!\n
Dani: Looks like we got bounced.\n
Dani: If you want to battle Pokémon\nwith us, you’ll have to bring more...\n
Walking along with luggage and your\ncompanion Pokémon gives a great feeling\fof outdoor life!\r
Yaha! I lost!\n
Are you also on a solo journey?\nSee you again sometime. Bye for now!\n
I’m headed out on a picnic. Do you\nknow why?\r
You are pretty good!\n
The reason I’m going on a picnic...\rIt’s because I really want to smell\nthe fresh air...\rDo you know what I mean?\n
Hey! Hugh!\r
I mistook you for someone else...\n
I came to explore Mt. Mortar, but I got\nseparated from my partner...\rDid you run into a Trainer who uses a\nSEADRA? That SEADRA is really good at\fusing Waterfall.\n
Yo! Markus!\r
Oops!\nI really mixed you up!\n
I came to explore Mt. Mortar, but I got\nseparated from my partner...\rDid you run into a Trainer who uses a\nSLOWPOKE? That SLOWPOKE is really good\fat using Strength.\n
I’m not losing this time!\r
I lost to some kid?\n
A while back, this karate guy wanted\nto battle. He was ridiculously good.\rHe just thrashed me silly.\rHe said something about training and\nwent in deeper. I wonder why?\n
Were you really watching?\n
Duff: Watching over my girlfriend makes\nmy heart soar!\r
Duff: I was no match for you...\n
Duff: Thank you for the awe-inspiring\nbattle! Bye!\n
Duff: If you want to fight with us,\nyou’ll need more than one Pokémon.\n
Eda: My heart’s feelings for my\nboyfriend are as wide and deep as\fthe ocean.\r
Eda: You’re really something...\n
Eda: You should really find a wonderful\npartner, too.\n
Eda: Uh-oh. You’ve only got\none Pokémon?\n
Thom: One plus one is two. But the two\nof us together is much stronger!\r
Thom: That wasn’t what I expected...\n
Thom: It seems your power is impossible\nto predict!\n
Thom: You should carry more Pokémon\nwith you, right?\n
Kae: The two of us aren’t just some\nboring pair!\r
Kae: You’re unusual, too!\n
Kae: I figured you were an ordinary\nlone Trainer. Boy, was I wrong!\n
Kae: Didn’t you know you need at\nleast two Pokémon to battle us?\n
Longing for others is...what it is...\rBut battles are battles, so let’s go!\r
Wah ha ha!\n
After a battle, you should always leave\nwith a parting laugh!\n
I’m not good with large crowds, so\nI’m camping out here with my Pokémon!\fAre you the same way?\r
I should be headed deeper into the\nmountain, I guess...\n
See ya!\n
Did you see that, Clair?\n
Oh, I see...\n
Oh, you are a cute little Trainer!\nWhy don’t you battle me?\r
You’re good...\n
Oh, I’ve learned something. There are\npeople like you out there who are very\fskilled even though they’re young...\n
Hey hey there, you young Trainer!\nWon’t you battle with me?\r
Wow, you’re strong...\n
You...\nI wonder what your future holds...\n
Mmmmph... I just woke up.\nI couldn’t focus...\n
What in the world was that? Don’t tell\nme some inexperienced kid can\fpossibly be that strong!\n
What was that?\n
What in the world are you?\n
