Eusine: My name is Eusine.\rI’m on the trail of a Pokémon named\nSUICUNE.\rAnd you are...?\n{STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}? Glad to meet you.\rI heard rumors that SUICUNE is here,\nso I came to look.\rTake a look at the basement through\nthe hole in the floor.\rThere. SUICUNE is down there.\rI could go downstairs, but I know it\nwould run away in no time.\rI know.\nI have tried it many times...
Eusine: There seems to be more than\nmeets the eye with you...
Morty: My name is Morty.\nI am Ecruteak’s Gym Leader.\rBecause my old friend Eusine is here\non the trail of SUICUNE, I decided to\finvestigate the Burned Tower.\rEcruteak has a legend about these\nlegendary Pokémon:\fSUICUNE, ENTEI, and RAIKOU.\rAs the Gym Leader of Ecruteak, I must\nhave a proper understanding of it.
