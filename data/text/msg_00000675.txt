Hey, can I get your number?\nI’ll ring you up to battle. {YESNO 0}
I’ll ring you whenever I get the urge\nto battle!
Oh, all right...\nBut I won’t lose to you again!
Can I get your phone number?\rI don’t want to lose against you!\nWe have to battle again, OK? {YESNO 0}
And yet another loss...\nNo doubt about it--you’re tough.\rBeing beaten this often actually feels\ngood now!\rHere, take this.\nUse it to get even tougher. That will\ftoughen me up, too!\r
Hey, you’re nearby, aren’t you? What’s\nwith the phone call? Come talk to me!
Hey, do you remember my super-cool\n{STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}?\rMy {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is different from\nregular {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}.\rIt’s like my {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} is in the top\npercentage of {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}.\rDo you know what I’m saying?
Oh yeah, I took down a {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}\nin the wild the other day.\rIt was a cakewalk. Well, I guess it\ncan’t be helped, us being so tough.\rAll right. Later!
Oh yeah, I saw a wild {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}!\nI thought about going for it, but\fthen I failed!\rOh well. I guess that’s just the way\nit goes. I’m not very good at catching\fPokémon...
Let’s get together and battle!\nI promise things will be different!\r{STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}’s where I’ll be.\nGive me a shout when you come.\rAll right. Later!
What’s keeping you, {STRVAR_1 3, 0, 0}?\rLet’s get down and battle already!\nI’m waiting on {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!
I’m checking out {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0}’s moves\nand devising some strategies.\rWhen I come up with a good one,\nlet’s battle!\rAll right. Later!
