There are eight Gyms in Kanto.\rThat big building is Vermilion’s\nPokémon Gym.
Skilled Trainers gather in Kanto.\nGym Leaders are especially strong.\rThey won’t be easy to defeat.
You’ve started to collect Kanto\nGym Badges?\rDon’t you agree that the Trainers\nhere are tough?
I guess you’ll be finished with your\nconquest of Kanto Gyms soon.\rLet me know if you get all\neight Badges.
Congratulations!\nYou got all the Kanto Gym Badges.\rI’ve got a reward for your efforts.\r

LATIAS is a Pokémon that has a lot\nto do with Soul Dew, a gemlike Orb.\rConsidering the fact that LATIAS is now\nin Kanto, it is possible to assume that\fthis has to do with the Soul Dew.\r
