You know, I’m going to practice a whole\nbunch so we can battle again the next\ftime we meet.\rThat’s right! Give me your phone\nnumber so I can call you! {YESNO 0}
All right, registration complete!\nLater!
That’s too bad...
Hey! You really want to trade phone\nnumbers with me, don’t you? {YESNO 0}
Huh?\nI can hear the sound of a windmill...\rThat must mean that you’re nearby,\naren’t you?\rSo come have a proper conversation!
My {STRVAR_1 0, 10, 0} works really hard!\rEverything I learn at school, it helps\nme repeat it right away.\rDo your Pokémon listen to what you say?
Yesterday we battled a {STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}!\rWe practiced all the stuff I learned\nin school!\rWhere do you go to school?\nSeriously, you don’t go to my school?\fThat can’t be true, can it?
Recently I was trying to catch a\n{STRVAR_1 0, 11, 0}, but it ran away!\fSo disappointing!\rAnd so I don’t forget how disappointing\nit was, I’m writing down the name of the\fPokémon that got away on my notebook.\rThere’re Pokémon names all over\nmy notebook!
Hey, come battle me again.\nI’ll be waiting at {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}!
Hello? I’m at {STRVAR_1 4, 3, 0}. We\nwere going to battle, weren’t we?\fHurry on over!
Huh? The only time you ever see me is\nwhen I’m on my way home from school?\rI suppose you’re right...\rBut when I’m on my way to school, I’m\nalways in a rush so that I’m not late.\rI don’t have any time for Pokémon\nbattles then!
